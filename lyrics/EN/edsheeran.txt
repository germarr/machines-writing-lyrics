i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
last night you were in my room
and now my bed sheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
i'm in love with your body
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
i'm in love with your body
come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
i'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
baby, i'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
i have faith in what i see
now i know i have met an angel in person
and she looks perfect
i don't deserve this
you look perfect tonight
and i'm on my way, i still remember
these old country lanes
when we did not know the answers
and i miss the way you make me feel, it's real
we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
over the castle on the hill
‘cause baby you look happier, you do
i knew one day you’d fall for someone new
but if he breaks your heart like lovers do
just know that i’ll be waiting here for you
hallelujah
you were an angel in the shape of my mum
you got to see the person i have become
spread your wings and i know
that when god took you back
he said, "hallelujah, you're home"
so baby, now, take me into your loving arms
kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, i'm thinking out loud
that maybe we found love right where we are
oh baby, we found love right where we are
and we found love right where we are
she played the fiddle in an irish band
but she fell in love with an english man
kissed her on the neck and then i took her by the hand
said, "baby, i just want to dance"
my pretty little galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
my, my, my, my, my, my, my galway girl
you're a mystery
i've travelled the world
and there's no other girl like you
no one, what's your history? (what's your history?)
do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'cause i heard you do, mmm
so don't call me baby
unless you mean it
don't tell me you need me
if you don't believe it
let me know the truth
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you
before i dive right into you
when i'm away, i will remember how you kissed me
under the lamppost back on sixth street
hearing you whisper through the phone
"wait for me to come home"
(knock, knock, knock) on my hotel door
i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next (you bastard)
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat (you bastard)
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my home
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
and we're all under the upper hand
and go mad for a couple grams
and we don't want to go outside tonight
and in a pipe we fly to the motherland
or sell love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
angels to fly
fly, fly
for angels to fly
to fly, to fly
for angels to die
so join me in this bed that i’m in
push up on me and sweat, darling
so i'm gonna put my time in (time in)
and won’t stop until the angels sing
jump in that water, be free
come south of the border with me
jump in that water, be free
come south of the border with me (rrrat)
flawless diamonds
in a green field near buenos aires
until the sun's rising
we won't stop until the angels sing
jump in that water, be free
come south of the border with me
jump in that water, be free
come south of the border with me

i see fire, burning the trees
i see fire, hollowing souls
i see fire, blood in the breeze
i see fire (oh you know i saw a city burning out)
i see fire (feel the heat upon my skin)
i see fire
and i see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
l.a. on a saturday night in the summer
sundown and they all come out
lamborghinis and their rented hummers
the party's on, so they're headin' downtown ('round here)
everybody's lookin' for a come up
and they wanna know what you're about
me in the middle with the one i love and
we're just tryna figure everything out
that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful
yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful (beautiful)
l.a., mmm
drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
i see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (all night)
i'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful, yeah
yeah, that's not who we are (we are, we are, we are)
we are not beautiful (beautiful)
we are, we are, we are
we are not beautiful
and i'll find comfort in my pain eraser

you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i wanna crack on and i wanna be paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i wanna crack on and i wanna be paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name

(hey, hey, hey)
i can still remember (what?) tryna shop a deal (uh-huh)
from taco bell to trl
i climbed the billboard charts to the top until
as fate would have it (yeah), became an addict
funny 'cause i had pop appeal
but they said time would tell (what?) if i'd prevail (huh?)
and all i did was (what?) put nine-inch nails (where?)
in my eyelids now (what?)
i'm seein' diamond sales like i'm in zales (yeah)
without a doubt, by any means
if rap was skinny jeans, i couldn't do anything in 'em
i'd be splitting seams of denim when i'm spitting schemes
which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
you sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
not even when i'm on my deathbed
man, i feel like ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
so why would i quit?
the thought that i would stop when i'm dead
just popped in my head
i said it, then forgot what i said
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
and it's about time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
you know it ain't my time to call it a day
i got rap locked and i'm already paid
but it's 'bout time you remember the name
ayy, ayy
(hey, hey, hey)
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
but i'm positive that he don't wanna know about
i don't wanna know about your new man
(one, two)

oh, i will hold on to the afterglow
oh, i will hold on to the afterglow

spending my life
falling deeper in love with you

tell me that you love me too
tell me that you love me too
she and i went on the run

down by the wexford border
she was nancy mulligan
and i was william sheeran
she took my name and then we were one
down by the wexford border

we could change this whole world with a piano
add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
i'm just a boy with a one-man show
no university, no degree, but lord knows
everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
and the stock market crashing and their portfolios
while i'll be sitting here with a song i wrote
sing, love could change the world in a moment
but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment
but what do i know?
love can change the world in a moment
if you cross her, then you cross me (cross me)
and nobody's comin' close, yeah
and i think that you should know that
if you cross her
(anything she needs, she can call me)
then you cross me
(don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me)
so come on, and let it go
oh, i think that you should know

we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too

come on, be my baby, come on
come on, be my baby, come on
i'm in love with your body
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
life can get you down so i just numb the way it feels
i drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
and all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
no farewell
so before i save someone else, i've got to save myself
and before i blame someone else, i've got to save myself
and before i love someone else, i've got to love myself
i'm out of touch, i'm out of love
i'll pick you up when you're getting down
and out of all these things i've done
i will love you better now
every night i kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby
i feel safe when you're holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah
every night i kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
hands in your hair
fingers and thumbs, baby
i feel safe when you're holding me near
love the way that you conquer your fear
you know hearts don't break around here
yeah, yeah, yeah
you know hearts don't break around here
oh yeah, yeah, yeah
someone told me, "always say what's on your mind"
and i am only being honest with you, i
i get lonely and make mistakes from time to time

you look so wonderful in your dress
i love your hair like that
and in a moment i knew you, beth
now i'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
that’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
see me lose focus as i sing to you loud
i can't, no, i won't hush
i'll say the words that make you blush
i'm gonna sing this now (oh, oh)
see, i’m true, my songs are where my heart is
i'm like glue, i stick to other artists
i'm not you, now that would be disastrous
let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
see, i'm real, i do it all, it's all me
i'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
i won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'cause you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
and for how long i love my lover?
for how long i love my lover, now, now?
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now?
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now?
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now? (and i feel love)
for how long-long i love my lover?
(feel it all over now now and i feel love)
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and i feel love)
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and i feel love)
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and i feel love)
for how long-long i love my lover, now, now
(feel it all over now now and i feel love)
for how long i love my lover, now, now?

won’t you let me know

if you love me
come on, get involved
feel it rushin' through you
from your head to toe

jet plane headed up to the sky
spread wings in the clouds, getting high
we ain't hit a rave in a while
so take me back to london (yo)
i do deals, but i never get twanged (twanged)
moves that ain't ever been planned (planned)
no goons that were never in gangs (gangs)
where i'm from, chat shit get banged (what?)
where i'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand (hand)
i don't mix with the glitz and the glam (glam)
all these stupid pricks on the 'gram
i don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
i'm way too g'd up to beef with grime neek
i bought an ap to help me time keep
my shooter ride deep, he moves when i speak
my shooter ride (ride), he shoot a guy (guy)
leave you wet like you scuba dived
we were younger then and now we're unified
south london boys, get you crucified, i'm gone
it's that time
big mike and teddy are on grime
i wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
because nobody thinks i write rhymes
and now i'm back in the bits with my guy
give me a packet of crisps with my pint
i hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'cause i haven't been home in time, yes, i
but that's my fault (oh)
grossed half a billi' on the divide tour (oh)
yes, i ain't kidding, what would i lie for? (oh)
but now i'm back on the track with big michael (woah)
he said, "teddy, never get off your high horse
and never let 'em take your crown"
i've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
but i'm heading back to london town right now
jet plane headed up to the sky (to the sky)
spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woop, woop)
we ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
so take me back to london
bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (ceilin' low)
sweat brow drippin' down, when in rome (when in rome)
no town does it quite like my home
so take me back to london
yo, when i squeeze off this little pen of mine
done the remix, now i got ed on grime
and this ain't like any top ten of mine
i arrived at wembley ahead of time
and that's stadiums, man are aliens
i drink supermalts and vibranium
i got an rm11 titanium
and i rock a 5970 daily, but
i want soul, i want flows
don't need tags ripping off my clothes
don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
and ted said, "that's just the way things go"
it's just the way things go, amazin' flows
grime or rap, man, i gave 'em both
took this sound that was made in bow
went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a badingham pub
i told stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
and you'll go through tears with the people you love
but when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'cause you can win brits (it don't stop)
and you can do glasto (headline slot)
but when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
jet plane headed up to the sky (to the sky)
spread wings in the clouds, getting high (getting high)
we ain't hit a rave in a while (in a while)
so take me back to london
bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (ceilin' low)
sweat brow drippin' down, when in rome (when in rome)
no town does it quite like my home (like my home)
so take me back to london
so take me back to london
all my senses come to life
while i'm stumbling home as drunk as i
have ever been and i'll never leave again
cause you are the only one
and all my friends have gone to find
another place to let their hearts collide
just promise me, you'll always be a friend
cause you are the only one
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind
calling out across the line
all the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
calling out across the line (and i saw scars upon her)
all the voices in my mind (tell me when it kicks in)
calling out across the line (brokenhearted)

and my father and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
and my brother and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
and my brother and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
and all my brother and my sisters
and my father and all of my family
rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
my dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
till i deliver the hype, am i just living a lie?
with this you must know that the numbers just sold
will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
we forget 90 percent of it when we wake
but the other 10 percent, it never fades
dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
a couple years ago i couldn't just control that thought
you'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
now i'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
you can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
i'm not a rapper, i'm a singer, i just take the piss
and most of these other guys are kids that pose
his little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
you'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
igh!
because, if i was gonna go somewhere
i'd be there by now
and maybe i can let myself down (wo-oahh)
and thinking i am unaware, i keep my feet on the ground
keep looking around, to make sure i'm not, the only one to feel low
because if you want, i'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
from all that i've done wrong
and i'll know you'll say, that i'm the only one
but i know god made another one of me
to love you better than i ever will
'cause you and i
ended over u-n-i
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
you and i
ended over u-n-i
and i said that's fine
but you're the only one that knows i lied
baby, the best part of me is you (whoa)
lately, everything's making sense, too
oh, baby, i'm so in love with you (oh)
baby, i'm so in love with you (yeah, yeah)
oh, baby, i'm so in love with you

he said, "teddy, never get off your high horse
and never let 'em take your crown"
i've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
but i'm heading back to london town right now
jet plane headed up to the sky (to the sky)
spread wings in the clouds, getting high (woop, woop)
we ain't hit a rave in a while (in a what?)
so take me back to london
bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (ceilin' low)
sweat brow drippin' down, when in rome (when in rome)
no town does it quite like my home (they don't)
so take me back to—
it's make it or break
human man, still make a mistake
mad now aitch just made a mixtape
told jaykae to make the next eight
we 'bout to set pace, i can't get about no more it gets bait
and i don't get head no more, i get face
she don't want him no more, she wants jay
and she don't want me no more, she wants aitch (aye)
jaykae, make a lot of p (uh)
go straight there if that's where i've got to be
wait, stop, pop my collar, i'm a g
5 million minimum, what i wanna see

aim this one at your head
write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead
jet plane headed up to the sky (0161)
spread wings in the clouds, getting high (0121)
we ain't hit a rave in a while (london city)
so take me back to london (woo)
bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
sweat brow drippin' down, when in rome
no town does it quite like my home (like my home)
so take me back to london
love will come and love will go
but you can't make it on your own
sing that song, go
oh won't you leave me now?
people grow and fall apart
but you can't mend your broken heart
take it back, go
oh won't you leave me now?
[chorus (extended)]
oh nina
you should go, nina
(love will come and love will go)
cause i ain't never coming home, nina
(but you can make it on your own)
oh, won't you leave me now?
(sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
and i've been living on the road, nina
(people grow and fall apart)
but then again you should know, nina
(but you can mend your broken heart)
cause that’s you and me both, nina
(take it back, go oh won't you leave me now)
oh, won't you leave me now, now?
oh nina
you should go, nina
(love will come and love will go)
cause i ain't never coming home, nina
(but you can make it on your own)
oh, won't you leave me now?
(sing that song, go oh won't you leave me now)
and i've been living on the road, nina
(people grow and fall apart)
but then again you should know, nina
(but you can mend your broken heart)
cause that’s you and me both, nina
oh, won't you leave me now, now?
you were just a small bump unborn
just four months then torn from life
maybe you were needed up there
but we're still unaware as why
and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try and get me to stop
but you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i’ll take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and i'll make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and i'll carve it like this necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now
cos maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
or maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
and oh, i know
and oh, i know
and oh
i can see the stars
from america
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't want you no
anymore
i don't love you baby
i don't need you baby
i don't wanna love you no
anymore
i'm just drunk again
i'll be drunk again
i'll be drunk again
to feel a little love
i love him from my skin to my bones
but i don't wanna live in his home
there’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
i'll just runaway and be on my own
i was rolling up something with you
kickin' back in a way that we do
i got everything i need in this room
smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
and all my friends are in the club
and they keep ringin' my phone (prr)
but they ain't got nothing on you (ah, ah)
and you ain't got nothing on you (leones con flow)
mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
a besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (yo'; ¡wuf!)
pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (ey; wuh)
y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
que te diga que no te voy a soltar
i was rolling up something with you (¡wuh!)
kickin' back in a way that we do
i got everything i need in this room
smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
and all my friends are in the club
and they keep ringin' my phone (prr)
but they ain't got nothing on you
and you ain't got nothing on you
i was rolling up something with you
kickin' back in a way that we do
i got everything i need in this room
smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
and all my friends are in the club
and they keep ringin' my phone (brrt)
but they ain't got nothing on you
and you ain't got nothing on you
she was like "damn¨
boy, i never took you for a one night stand"
she was like "damn¨
boy, i never took you for a one night stand"
want to be your man
"boy, i never took you for a one night stand"
she was like "damn¨
and you ain't got nothing on you
so live life like you’re giving up
'cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart, and hold on
so live life like you're giving up
'cause you act like you are
go ahead and just live it up
go on and tear me apart, and hold on
and we're all under the upper hand
and going mad for a couple grams
and we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
and sell love to another man
it's too cold outside
for angels to fly
for angels to fly
and fly, fly
for angels to fly
to fly, to fly
and angels to die
hey, baby, we can dance slowly (hey)
my, darlin', i'll be all you need, you need (oh)
i know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
so put it all on me
oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
can't judge you 'cause i feel the same thing
and i'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
to put it all on me (babe)
love, on me, o-o-on me (on me)
hey baby, we can dance slowly (slow)
love, on me, o-o-on me
put your, put your, put your worries on me
love, on me, o-o-on me (on me)
hey, baby, we can dance slowly
and i'm here for whatever you need (need)
so put it all on me
i try to be strong, but i got demons
so can i lean on you?
i need a strong heart and a soft touch
and you're the one when i want love
well, the seas are full of water
stops by the shore
it's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
never reach the poor
and let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
and let lightning be the veins
but fill the sky with all that they can draw
when it's time to make a change
[chorus (extended)]
make it rain
make it rain down, lord

nando's from me, fat chance i gotta black card
if you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
in your left cheek i eat nando's every week
sometime on a tuesday, sometime on a thursday (yo)
i get free drinks, refillable even when i'm thirsty
on a thursday i eat chicken in the worst ways
i love nando's more than your mum does
more than your mum does
nando's (i say oh)
i love nando's
my tongue is on fire
i wanna say elliot (yes ed?)
nando's i desire (i'll give it to you anytime you want babe)

i want some nando's
i want some nando's
i want some nando's (right now)
i want some nando's right now
a man may drink and not be drunk
a man may fight and not be slain
a man may court a pretty girl
and perhaps be welcomed back again
but since it has so ought to be
by a time to rise and a time to fall
come fill to me the parting glass
good night and joy be with you all
good night and joy be with you all
i'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
mum sayin', "don't smoke," no, i don't listen, i got
love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
people that i don't know share the same vision
i find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
sometimes i can't write, sentences can't rhyme
starin' at my notepad quick, i'm tryin' to find mine
shit quick before i hit it again
surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
and who knew that i'd be paid just to pick up a pen
just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
i'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
my daddy told me, "work hard and you can never be shit"
i've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
one wish
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are warm
for hands of gold are always cold
but a woman's hands are ...
touch down
like a seven four seven
we'll stay out and we'll live forever now...
your hand in mine
some things were just meant to be
hearts intertwined
some things were just meant to be
in perfect time
some things were just meant to be
oh you and i
some things were just meant to be
your hand in mine
some things were just meant to be
hearts intertwined
some things were just meant to be
in perfect time
some things were just meant to be
oh you and i
some things were just meant to be
your hand in mine
some things were just meant to be
hearts intertwined
some things were just meant to be
in perfect time
some things were just meant to be
oh you and i
some things were just meant to be
your hand in mine
some things were just meant to be
hearts intertwined
some things were just meant to be
in perfect time
some things were just meant to be
oh you and i
some things were just meant to be
this the type of shit we used to dream of (yeah, yeah)
bad bitch look like mona lisa (mona lisa)
flippin' off a yacht in ibiza (splash, water)
clear port, hasta la vista
do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
teacher said i would lose, i be like, "what now?"
i started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, i'm the plug now
and now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
i see it, i like it, i wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
the millions get wired, them benny hunnids still go in pocket
i party with ed sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'cause i'm so hood, it don't make no sense
still remember the times i couldn't pay my rent
now, i walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "play my shit"
and they gon' sing like this
last night, i played a show at a stadium in atlanta
husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
i never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
everything is already part of a plan
i remember, damn, me and my man inside of this splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
stayin' up in every city's holiday inn
if it wasn't there, then i was at the couch of a friend's
wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
on to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (woo)
and i don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things i do
oh, let me invite you to my world
oh, i been on for a thousand nights
new york to london, different city every day, yeah
playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
oh, i've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (gettin' faded)
so i'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
oh, i been on for a thousand nights
new york to london, different city every day, yeah
playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
oh, i've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
so i'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
friends should sleep in other beds
and friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
and i know that there's a limit to everything
but my friends won't love me like you
no, my friends won't love me like you do
oh, my friends will never love me like you

king of the kings, do you feel any pain?
king of the kings, do you feel any pain?
king of the kings, do you feel any pain?
'cause with the lyrics i'll be aiming it right
i won't stop until my name's in lights
at stadium heights, with damian rice
on red carpets, now i'm on arabian nights
because i'm young, i know my brothers gonna give me advice
long nighter, short height and i gone hyper
never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
the game's over but now i'm on a new level
watch how i step on the track without a loop pedal
people think that i'm bound to blow up
i've done around about a thousand shows but
i haven't got a house plus i live on a couch
so you believe the lyrics when i'm singing them out
wow, from day one i've been prepared
with v05 wax for my ginger hair
now i'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
what the future holds cause it's another day
plus
i'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
and i'll be breaking into other people's tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
i'm selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cds from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
i hit back, when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke, never growing up, call me rufio
melody music maker, reading all the papers
they say i'm up and coming like i'm fucking in an elevator
tell me if i'm wrong
tell me if i'm right
tell me if you need a loving hand
to help you fall asleep tonight

i don't even know if she knows what for
she was crying on my shoulder, i already told ya
trust and respect is what we do this for
i never intended to be next
but you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
and i never saw him as a threat
until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
it's not like we were both on tour
we were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
and i wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
but it was never just fun, and i thought you were different
this is not the way you realised what you wanted
it's a bit too much, too late if i'm honest
and all this time, god knows i'm singing
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my arm
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
that heart is so cold
all over my arm
i don't wanna know that babe
don't fuck with my love
i told her she knows
take aim and reload
i don't wanna know that babe
letra de "shape of you (remix)" ft. zion & lennox
yo llegué solo en busca de ti
ya me imagino lo que vamo' a hacer
sé que andas sola en busca de mí, yo lo sé
dame, dame de eso, mamacita
yo quiero más de ti (eh-eh-eh)
dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti
i'm in love with the shape of you (zu)
we push and pull like a magnet do (chris jeday)
although my heart is falling too (gaby music)
i'm in love with your body (zu-zu)
last night you were n my room (zu)
and now my bedsheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with the shape of you
and like the back of her hand
she already understands everything
"won’t you stay?" she says
and she already knows how it goes
and where she stands
i’ll stay, anyway
cause she knows me so well
oh, she knows me like i know myself
oh, she knows me so well
oh, she knows me like i know myself
i know myself
oh, she knows me like i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
i know myself
my loneliness is killing me, and i
i must confess i still believe, still believe
when you're not with me, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
when i'm not with you, i lose my mind
give me a sign
hit me baby one more time
she said we are penguins on the ice
we're not meant to fly
but god knows we can try
oh, i see a hope that's in your eyes
can you feel the love in mine?
can you feel the love in mine?
it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
and it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
and it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
and it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
and it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
and it's not a homeless life for me
it's just i'm home less than i'd like to be
it's not a homeless life for me, yeah
but i do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
when i see my friends, all they say is hold up
ed, remember the time
when we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
you know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
so maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way
and maybe you should learn to love her
like, like the way you wanna be loved
'cause if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
oh, if you like the way you look that much
oh baby, you should go and love yourself
and if you think that i'm still holdin' on to somethin'
you should go and love yourself
oh, my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
oh, my heart still beats for my home and my english rose
i'm at a party i don't wanna be at
and i don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
wonderin' if i could sneak out the back
nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
and then you take my hand
finish my drink, say, "shall we dance?" (hell, yeah)
you know i love ya, did i ever tell ya?
you make it better like that
don't think i fit in at this party
everyone's got so much to say (yeah)
i always feel like i'm nobody, mmm
who wants to fit in anyway?
'cause i don't care when i'm with my baby, yeah
all the bad things disappear
and you're making me feel like maybe i am somebody
i can deal with the bad nights
when i'm with my baby, yeah
mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'cause i don't care as long as you just hold me near
you can take me anywhere
and you're making me feel like i'm loved by somebody
i can deal with the bad nights
when i'm with my baby, yeah
when i'm with my baby, yeah
'cause when i'm missing you
i'll stop eating food and i'll squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you left too, i thought i’d put you to a test
and say that i love you, i think that i love you
and i'll stop eating food and i'll squeeze into your dress
so i can feel like you and then i'll see your bitterness
and why you left me too, i thought i’d put you to a test
and say that i love you, now it seems you loved me too
there's a firefly loose tonight
better catch it before it burns this place down
and i lie if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better through your eyes
there's a firefly loose tonight
better catch it before it burns this place down
and i lie if i don't feel so right
but the world looks better through your eyes
behind my truth lies
everything you want
behind my truth lies
everything you want
behind my truth lies
everything you are
hey ay ay yeah

and you know, you know
and you know, in this foreign car whippin' out
and you know, you know
and you know, in this foreign car let it go
it seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
another couple based on teen sex
you eejit, true i was just like you
we couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
'cause you're so cool
you're so beautiful
you're so... and you're so...
you're so cool
you're so beautiful
you're so... and you're so...
we could go to berlin, tokyo or jamaica
through the streets of new york, that is where i will take ya
paris, rome, to rio, passing through las vegas
we can go where you want, say the word and i'll take ya
but i'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
on the sofa with you
would you fall too?
would you fall too?
would you fall too?
would you fall too?
yellow diamonds in the light
and we're standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
what it takes to come alive
it's the way i'm feeling i just can't deny
but i've gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
shine a light through an open door
love and life i will divide
turn away cause i need you more
feel the heart beat in my mind
it's the way i'm feeling i just can't deny
but i've gotta let it go
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
yellow diamonds in the light
and we're standing side by side
as your shadow crosses mine
what it takes to come alive
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
we found love in a hopeless place
i brush my teeth every night but still i wake up with a bad mouth
and the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
deliver the raps how i flow, i live with the rats now and those
that hate me call me ron but they won't slither in too easy
believe me i'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that i'm in
it's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
i try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
some of the songs i write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
i'm still broke without the money for a mac pro
living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
opposite of sober cause i never did my homework
which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
i played a fool to catch the wise, i will never tell a lie
i wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die (never die)
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
it could be
the times i'm living in
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
it could be
the times i'm living in lately
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
it could be
the times i'm living in
i never sleep
when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
it could be
the times i'm living in lately
cause you need me, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you (at all)
you need me, man, i don't need you

you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, (my eyes are red!)
(you need me, man, i don't need you)
(you need me, man, my eyes are red!)
you need me, man, i don't need you
millwall are winning i think
i'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when i chase it
and replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
into another rappers shoes using new laces
selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
selling cd's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
i hit back when the pen hurts me
i'm still a choir boy in a fenchurch tee
i'm still the same as a year ago
but more people hear me though
according to the myspace and youtube videos
i'm always doing shows if i'm not i'm in the studio
truly broke, never growing up call me ruffio
melody music maker
reading all the papers
they say i'm up and coming like i'm fucking in an elevator
later!
thank you... thank you so much! see you soon!
girl, you know i want your love
your love was handmade for somebody like me
come on now, follow my lead

grab on my waist and put that body on me

come, come on now, follow my lead (everybody, sing it loud)

i'm in love with the shape of you
we push and pull like a magnet do
although my heart is falling too
i'm in love with your body
and last night you were in my room
and now my bedsheets smell like you
every day discovering something brand new
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body
oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i
i'm in love with your body

every day discovering something brand new (uzi)
i'm in love with the shape of you
come on, come on be my baby
come on, i can't wait for long
you know i love your body but i hate that you a star
no, i do not really need you 'cause you know i ball
(i'm in love with your body)
yeah, i'm in love with the shape of you
no, it do not matter if you're skinny or you're tall
if you're thicker than a snicker or you're small
get the picture when i kiss you
diamonds gleaming, they be shining on my wrist (my wrist)
and i don't know why they be always acting bitter (i don't know)
'cause they know that i'm the one that's gonna get her
i don't really care if you cry
on the real, you shoulda never lied
saw the way she looked me in my eyes
she said: "i am not afraid to die."
all my friends are dead
push me to the edge
all my friends are dead, yeah
push me to the edge
all my friends are dead, yeah
all my friends are dead, yeah
(p money)
i feel like i had plastic surgery, cause today i looked in the mirror an' realised i'm faced with neglection
feeling like i'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, i don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from inception
looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come i didn't even get a mention?"
shocking. i think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
i signed to music for twenty-three years, now i'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
i'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, i see the tension
now i'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause i got no reception
ah, no bars, get it?
now i'm choking, no bars, get it?
it turned cloudy, no stars, get it?
i hit the ground so hard, headache
ah, it's mad
i should be proud right now but i'm sad
cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad
(ed sheeran)
i'm out of touch, in a cold december
now
keep me warm
i'm out of sight
with all these things i've done
don't hold me down
it's more than i can take
now
i'm out of sight
in a cold december
(p money)
uh, my mum walks past me. my brother prays asking why i have left them?
i didn't know i broke up with my girlfriend 'til i saw her with someone else in beckton
(wow)
i text her, "you dissed it". she don't reply like it's none of my business
my mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than limp bizkit
why'd you do me so wicked? something must've happened, how did i miss this?
love turns to pain, expressed with rage. i want justice but i got no witness (help)
now i'm powerless. probably why i'm fascinated with misfits
i guess i'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
ah, free, nobody understands but me
i don't think i got no-one but myself, so when i'm broke i still say "i got p"
ah, it's mad. i should be proud right now but i'm sad
cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad
(ed sheeran)
i'm out of touch, in a cold december
now
keep me warm
i'm out of sight
all these things i've done
don't hold me down
it's more than i can take
now
i'm out of sight
in a cold december
(p money)
so many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony
trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
so many turning their back on me
(wait)
it's slowly coming back to me
all i can see is the word tragedy, but i didn't think there was a fatality
uh, damn, i think i know why i don't see my dad
i think i know why my mum walks past
and why me and my girlfriend don't chat
see, all this time i thought i was mad
i know why i'm not proud and why i'm sad
i'm out of sight and touch, cause back in march i don't think i survived that crash
(ed sheeran)
i'm out of touch, in a cold december
now
keep me warm
i'm out of sight
with all these things i've done
don't hold me down
it's more than i can take
now
i'm out of sight
in a cold december
cold december (repeat till fade)
eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
i could hear voices and my phone ringing
fighting for life, can't tell if i'm winning
one of the worst situations i've been in
i could hear all of the angels singing
but when they stopped humming
my brain turned on, started running
still in pain, but it started numbing
the stone cold comeback i made was stunning
i still tried to do a few shows 'cos i didn't wanna tell them that i weren't coming
but i was left with a permanent problem
nobody knows about the pain that i'm in (sly)
ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
i used the first aid kit like a drum set
picked up the tools and i gave it a drumming
trust me, when it comes to mistakes
you can't afford to let one in
never done tunes for a while
the pipeline was blocked
so i learned and done a bit of plumbing
they say tomorrow never dies
but they forgot to tell you, you can
you can have a sicker clan than wu-tang
but when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
you can try beg for another
sometimes i'll be on my way to a show
thinking "i just wanna see my brother"
then do a u-turn, i'm gone, one up
to see my family
and keep it inside
dry eyes, while my brother weeps
save my soul
and i think you hate the smell of smoke
you always try to get me to stop
but you drink as much as me
and i get drunk a lot
so i take you to the beach
and walk along the sand
and i'll make you a heart pendant
with a pebble held in my hand
and i'll carve it like this necklace
so the heart falls where your chest is
now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
and it falls just where it needs to be
and rests peacefully
so you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
against yours now
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
[interlude: (gyptian - "hold yuh")]
girl me wann fi hold yuh
put me arms right around ya
girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
girl me just wann fi squeeze yah
put me arms right around ya
girl you give me the tightest love me eva get inna my life
oh in my life, oh
oh in my life, oh
oh in my life, ooh oh
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i'm just in love when you wake me up
maybe i fell in love when you woke me up
full lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!
*snippet*
oh my brother, why you've been
it's been the longest time apart
and i remember the days we were running free
long before you broke my heart
oh my brother, why you've been
it's been the longest time apart
and i remember the days we were running free
long before you broke my heart
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you
you need me, man, i don't need you, at all
you need me, man, i don't need you
i don’t know when i lost my mind
maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
that i miss you
tell me your secrets
give me a friend
let all the good times flood in
do i love you? do i hate you?
i can’t make up my mind
so let’s free fall and see where we land
i hope you can hear what i write to you
how could i say goodbye to you?
when i'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
i gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
you came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
just locked in a cage slaving
they said they were gold in the pavements
but you came and saw the road to amazement
broke your heart
but still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
i hope your listening right
i still think of you every sunday
no one can top your chicken and rice
even through the darkness times
you held us all up because your vision was bright
i knew your strength was your wisdom inside
you never let anyone see your heartache
you just got on with it
anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
and your words you would stand strong with it
cause they were like warmth on a winter night
but i was just too young to go on with it
and there somethings i could try to do
but it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
i couldn't do that, i owe my life to you
[hook 1: ed sheeran (dot rotten)]
and of the pieces of my soul
(because i need a sign, i hope this pain will heal in time)
you know i never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there?
can i say goodbye to you?
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
can i say goodbye to you? ohh
and of the pieces of my soul
(because i need a sign, i hope this pain will heal in time)
you know i never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there?
can i say goodbye to you?
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
can i say goodbye to you? ohh
i can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there?
and can i say goodbye to you?
and paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
feel the chill of your warm embrace?
and can i say goodbye to you?
i can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
and will you think of me up there?
can i say goodbye to you?
and paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
can i say goodbye to you?
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
they crawled out of the woodwork
and they whispered into your brain
they set you on the treadmill
and they made you change your name
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend ever did
loneliness was tough
the toughest role you ever played
hollywood created a superstar
and pain was the price you paid
even when you died
oh the press still hounded you
all the papers had to say
was that marilyn was found in the nude
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend never did
goodbye norma jean
though i never knew you at all
you had the grace to hold yourself
while those around you crawled
goodbye norma jean
from the young man in the 22nd row
who sees you as something as more than sexual
more than just our marilyn monroe
and it seems to me you lived your life
like a candle in the wind
never knowing who to cling to
when the rain set in
and i would have liked to have known you
but i was just a kid
your candle burned out long before
your legend never did
your candle burned out long before
your legend never did
can you feel it?
all the guys in here don't even wanna dance
can you feel it?
all that i can hear is music from the back
but can you feel it?
found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
before the beat kicks in again
can you feel it?
can you feel it?
[pre-chorus + chorus (simultaneous)]
and what i need to know
is if you love me and i
really need to know
if you need me when you
call
if you want me when you
call
cool
he's an intense guy, isn't he?
darling, you look perfect tonight
[chorus (extended): ed sheeran]
'cause you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me
'cause you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me
(3455538)
[[chorus (extended): ed sheeran]
'cause you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me
'cause you need me, man, i don’t need you

you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you
you need me, man, i don’t need you at all
you need me
i never had a playlist in my heart
now i need an a list just to chart
but i've been famous from the start
how am i gonna make my mark?
[chorus: ed sheeran & (jme)]
are you gonna play me though?
this song was never meant for the radio
(i get it in forget a radio spin, i'm just doing my thing
and i don't have time for a playlist)

oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
cause we be all night, love, love
we be all night, love, love
we be all night, love, love
we be all night, love
by the way, by the way, you do things to my body
i didn’t know that i was starving till i tasted you
i heard there was a secret chord
that david played, and it pleased the lord
but you don't really care for music, do you?
it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
the minor fall, the major lift
the baffled king composing hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
maybe there's a god above
but all i ever learned from love
was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
it's not a cry you can hear at night
it's not somebody who's seen the light
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
you said i took the name in vain
well, i never really knew that name
but if i did, what really is it to you?
i've seen your flag on the marble arch
love is not some victory march
it's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
your faith was strong but you needed proof
you saw her bathing on the roof
her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
she tied you to a kitchen chair
she broke your throne, and she cut your hair
and from your lips she drew the hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah, hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

i walk a-
so, so you think you can tell
heaven from hell
blue skys from pain
can you tell a green field
from a cold steel rail?
a smile from a veil?
do you think you can tell?
and did they get you to trade
your heroes for ghosts?
hot ashes for trees?
hot air for a cool breeze?
cold comfort for change?
and did you exchange
a walk on part in the war
for a lead role in a cage?
how i wish, how i wish you were here
we're just two lost souls
swimming in a fish bowl
year after year
running over the same old ground
what have we found?
the same old fears
wish you were here
you better wake up cause i a.m making moves
and even when i'm dozing i'm breaking rules
i'm only hitting the sack when i'm training
too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
made my bed and that's where i'm heading
i fly straight but the best man i embed 'em
married to the game was a quiet wedding
and i had to fight to get her, i am tekken (taking)
control of my inception
cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
see they better marry donna cause when i strike, back
not even argentina's gonna cry for them
see i'm awake at night, with the ammunish
cause the haters know where the family lives
anyone i catch playing knock down ginger
is gonna lose a lot more, than annie did
they say sleep is the cousin of death
but i ain't hearing that shh... cousin, i'm—
gang signs i'm in la reading (la reid'n)
i'm a ceo, mother suckers i'm next (sway)
when the darkness creeps in
i feel my nightmares watching me
and when my dreams are sleeping
i feel my nightmares watching me
i feel my nightmares watching me
i feel my nightmares watching me
watching me
so please come home
and we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
and we will write all our memories down
and we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
but darling i, i will keep you warm
oh darling i, i will keep you warm
darling i, i take you home
wishing my life away
but these three words
i have to say to you
my baby blue
you know it's true
i love you
wishing my life away
these three words
i have to say to you
my baby blue
you know it's true
you know it's true
i love you
i love you
i love you
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
leaves have fallen to the ground
and now there's no one else around
to hear the cry
oh oh
i saw your body
i saw your face
loss of presence
loss of grace
behind those eyes
oh oh
and we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
i miss your laughter
i miss your tears
i miss your rambling
about your fears
your smile
the crowd has gathered
all around
no ones speaking
no one makes a sound
and i...
and we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
alone
alone now...
they're never gonna change you
they're never gonna change me
they're never gonna change us
we'll always stay the same
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
we break down
we lose touch
sometimes
we are
alone
