just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
hope you're wearing your best clothes
you can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
you look pretty good down here
but you ain't really good


we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?
we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?


just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying, it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here


just stop your crying, have the time of your life
breaking through the atmosphere
and things are pretty good from here
remember everything will be alright
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here


we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?

we don't talk enough, we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn? we've been here before
it's just what we know


stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away, we got to get away
we got to get away, we got to get away
we got to get away
we got to, we got to, away

i'm in my bed
and you're not here
and there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
forget what i said
it's not what i meant
and i can't take it back, i can't unpack the baggage you left


what am i now? what am i now?
what if i'm someone i don't want around?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'
what if i'm down? what if i'm out?
what if i'm someone you won't talk about?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'


you said you cared, and you missed me too
and i'm well aware i write too many songs about you
and the coffee's out at the beachwood cafe
and it kills me 'cause i know we've run out of things we can say


what am i now? what am i now?
what if i'm someone i don't want around?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'
what if i'm down? what if i'm out?
what if i'm someone you won't talk about?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'


and i get the feeling that you'll never need me again


what am i now? what am i now?
what if you're someone i just want around?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'
what if i'm down? what if i'm out?
what if i'm someone you won't talk about?
i'm falling again, i'm falling again, i'm fallin'

lyrics from live performances


i’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine
treat you like a gentleman
give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
think i'm gonna stick with you
here to take my medicine, take my medicine
rest it on your fingertips
up to your mouth, i’m feeling it out
i’m felling it out


i had a few, got drunk on you, and now i'm wasted
and when i sleep i'm gonna dream of how you tasted


if you go out tonight, i'm going out 'cause i know you're persuasive
you got that salt, i got me an appetite, and now i can taste it
you get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
la la la la la
we're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh


tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
tingle running through my bones
the boys and the girls are here
i mess around with him
and i'm okay with it


i'm coming down, i figured out i kinda like it
and when i sleep, i'm gonna dream of how you ride it


if you go out tonight, i'm going out 'cause i know you're persuasive
you got that salt, i got me an appetite, and now i can taste it
you get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
la la la la la
we're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh


i had a few, got drunk on you, and now i'm wasted
and when i sleep, i’m gonna dream of how you tasted


if you go out tonight, i'm going out 'cause i know you're persuasive
you got that salt, i got me an appetite, and now i can taste it
you get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
la la la la la
we're gettting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh

what do you mean?
i'm sorry by the way
never coming back down
can't you see?
i could, but wouldn't stay
wouldn't put it like that
what do you mean?
i'm sorry by the way
never coming around
it'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
la-da-da-da-da


all the lights couldn't put out the dark
runnin' through my heart
lights up and they know who you are
know who you are
do you know who you are? (oh)


shine, step into the light
shine, so bright sometimes
shine, i'm not ever going back
shine, step into the light
shine, so bright sometimes
shine, i'm not ever going back
shine, step into the light
shine, so bright sometimes
shine, i'm not ever (ooh)

coucou


don't you call him "baby"
we're not talking lately
don't you call him what you used to call me


i, i confess i can tell that you are at your best
i'm selfish so i'm hating it
i noticed that there's a piece of you in how i dress
take it as a compliment


don't you call him "baby"
we're not talking lately
don't you call him what you used to call me


i, i just miss
i just miss your accent and your friends
did you know i still talk to them?


does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?


don't you call him "baby"
we're not talking lately
don't you call him what you used to call me
don't you call him "baby" (coucou)
we're not talking lately
don't you call him what you used to call me (coucou)


coucou ! tu dors ? oh, j'suis désolée...
bah non... nan, c'est pas important...
ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
parfait ! allez !

put a price on emotion
i'm looking for something to buy
you've got my devotion
but man, i can hate you sometimes
i don't want to fight you
and i don't want to sleep in the dirt
we'll get the drinks in
so i'll get to thinking of her


we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line


test of my patience
there's things that we'll never know
you sunshine, you temptress
my hand's at risk, i fold
crisp trepidation
i'll try to shake this soon
spreading you open
is the only way of knowing you


we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be alright
we'll be alright
we'll be a fine line
we'll be a fine line
we'll be alright (alright, alright, alright)


(we'll be alright)
(we'll be alright)
we'll be alright
we'll be alright
oh

she worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
and all the boys, they were saying they were into it
such a pretty face, on a pretty neck


she's driving me crazy, but i'm into it, but i'm into it
i'm kinda into it
it's getting crazy, i think i'm losing it, i think i'm losing it
oh, i think she said "i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
(it's none of your, it's none of your)
"i'm having your baby (hey, ah), it's none of your business" (oh)
"i'm having your baby (hey, hey), it's none of your, it's none of your" (ow!)


it's new york, baby, always jacked up (hey)
holland tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
when she's alone, she goes home to a cactus (uh)
in a black dress, she's such an actress


driving me crazy, but i'm into it, but i'm into it
i'm kinda into it
it's getting crazy, i think i'm losing it, i think i'm losing it
oh, i think she said "i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, it's none of your)
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"


she sits beside me like a silhouette
hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
and now she's all over me, it's like i paid for it (cha-ching!)
it's like i paid for it, i'm gonna pay for this


it's none of your, it's none of your
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"i'm having your baby, it's none of your business" (it's none of your, none of your)

hey!


golden, golden, golden as i open my eyes
hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
i know you were way too bright for me
i'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
brown my skin just right
you're so golden


you're so golden
i'm out of my head, and i know that you're scared
because hearts get broken


i don't wanna be alone
i don't wanna be alone when it ends
don't wanna let you know
i don't wanna be alone
but i can feel it take a hold (i can feel it take a hold)
i can feel you take control (i can feel you take control)
of who i am, and all i've ever known
lovin' you's the antidote
golden


you're so golden
i don't wanna be alone
you're so golden
you're so golden
i'm out of my head, and i know that you're scared
because hearts get broken


(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
(golden, golden, golden, golden)
i know that you're scared because i'm so open


you're so golden
i don't wanna be alone
you're so golden
you're so golden
you're so golden
i'm out of my head, and i know that you're scared
because hearts get broken

sweet creature
had another talk about where it's going wrong
but we're still young
we don't know where we're going
but we know where we belong


and, oh, we started
two hearts in one home
it's hard when we argue
we're both stubborn, i know
but oh


sweet creature, sweet creature
wherever i go, you bring me home
sweet creature, sweet creature
when i run out of road, you bring me home


sweet creature
running through the garden
oh, where nothing bothered us
but we're still young
i always think about you and how we don't speak enough


and, oh, we started
two hearts in one home
i know it's hard when we argue
we're both stubborn, i know
but oh


sweet creature, sweet creature
wherever i go, you bring me home
sweet creature, sweet creature
when i run out of road, you bring me home


and, oh, when we started
just two hearts in one home
it gets hard when we argue
we're both stubborn, i know
but oh


sweet creature, sweet creature
wherever i go, you bring me home
sweet creature, sweet creature
when i run out of road, you bring me home
you'll bring me home

same lips red, same eyes blue
same white shirt, couple more tattoos
but it's not you and it's not me
tastes so sweet, looks so real
sounds like something that i used to feel
but i can't touch what i see


we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat


the fridge light washes this room white
moon dances over your good side
and this was all we used to need
tongue-tied like we've never known
telling those stories we already told
'cause we don't say what we really mean


we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat


we're not who we used to be
we're not who we used to be
we're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
we're not who we used to be
we don't see what we used to see
we're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat


trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
i'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

nine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
and he's thinking of you, like all of us do
sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
around 1:32, like he knows what to do


she (she), she lives in daydreams with me (she)
she's the first one that i see, and i don't know why
i don't know who she is (she, she)


he takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away (away, away)
and not telling his mates (not telling his mates)
he wouldn't know what to say (wouldn't know what to say, to say)


she (she), she lives in daydreams with me (she)
she's the first one that i see, and i don't know why
i don't know who she is (she)
she (she), she's the first one that i see (she)
she lives in daydreams with me, and i don't know why
i don't know where she is (she, she)


lives for the memory
a woman who's just in his head (just in his head)
and she sleeps in his bed (his bed)
while he plays pretend (pretend)
so pretend (pretend)


she (she), she lives in daydreams with me (she)
she's the first one that i see, and i don't know why
i don't know who she is (she, she)
she (she), she's the first one that i see (she)
she lives in daydreams with me, and i don't know why
i don't know where she is (she, she)

sunflower
sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
let me inside, wish i could get to know you
sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
i was just tongue-tied


i don't wanna make you feel bad
but i've been trying hard not to talk to you
sunflower (sunflower, sunflower)


i couldn't want you any more
kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
i couldn't want you any more
tonight (tonight, tonight, tonight)


wondering, headshake
tired eyes are the death of me
mouthful of toothpaste before i got to know you
i've got your face hung up high in the gallery
i love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
let me inside, i wanna get to know you


i don't wanna make you feel bad
but i've been trying hard not to act a fool
sunflower (sunflower, sunflower)


i couldn't want you any more
kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
i couldn't want you any more
tonight (tonight, tonight, tonight)
i couldn't want you any more
kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
i couldn't want you any more
tonight (tonight, tonight, tonight)


sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
let me inside, wish i could get to know you
sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
i'm still tongue-tied

don't blame me for falling
i was just a little boy
don’t blame the drunk caller
wasn't ready for it all


you can't blame me, darling
not even a little bit, i was away
and i’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
who can't admit when he's sorry


don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
i know that you're tryna be friends, i know you mean it
don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
be so lonely


i just hope you see me in a little better light
do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’cause i miss the shape of your lips
you’ll win, it's just a trick
and this is it, so i’m sorry


don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
i know that you're tryna be friends, i know you mean it
don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
be so lonely


to be so lonely, to be so
to be so lonely
to be so lonely, to be so
to be so lonely


and i'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
who can't admit when he's sorry


don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
i know that you're tryna be friends, i know you mean it
don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
be so lonely


to be so lonely, to be so
to be so lonely
to be so lonely, to be so
to be so lonely

woke up alone in this hotel room
played with myself, where were you?
fell back to sleep, i got drunk by noon
i've never felt less cool


we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever be the first one to break?
even my phone misses your call, by the way


i saw your friend that you know from work
he said you feel just fine
i see you gave him my old t-shirt
more of what was once mine


i see it's written, it's all over his face
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say?
even my phone misses your call, by the way


maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
but you, you never do
woke up the girl who looked just like you
i almost said your name


we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say?
even my phone misses your call
we haven't spoke since you went away
comfortable silence is so overrated
why won't you ever say what you want to say?
even my phone misses your call, by the way

tell me something, tell me something
you don't know nothing, just pretend you do
i need something, tell me something new
choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
for this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
must this hurt you just before you go?


oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know


brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
there's no water inside this swimming pool
almost over, had enough from you
and i've been praying, i never did before
understand i'm talking to the walls
i've been praying ever since new york


oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know


tell me something, tell me something
you don't know nothing, just pretend you do
tell me something just before you go


oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know
oh, tell me something i don't already know

should we just search romantic comedies on netflix and then see what we find?


i'm selfish, i know
but i don't ever want to see you with him
i'm selfish, i know
i told you, but i know you never listen


i hope you can see the shape that i'm in
while he's touching your skin
he's right where i should, where i should be
but you're making me bleed


woman, woman (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
wo-woman, woman
woman, woman (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
wo-woman, woman (hey!)


tempted, you know
apologies are never gonna fix this (hmm-mm)
i'm empty, i know
and promises are broken like a stitch is


i hope you can see, the shape i've been in
while he's touching your skin
this thing upon me, howls like a beast
you flower, you feast




woman, woman (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
wo-woman, woman
woman, woman (la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la)
wo-woman, woman


woman

i saw this angel
i really saw an angel


open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
that i'm still the only one who's been in love with me
i'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
and there's nothing i can do about it
broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
i got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
but i think that's what i like about it


she's an angel, only angel
she's an angel, my only angel


i must admit i thought i'd like to make you mine
as i went about my business through the warning signs
end up meeting in the hallway every single time
and there's nothing we can do about it
told it to her brother and she told it to me
that she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
when it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
and there's nothing she can do about it


she's an angel, only angel
she's an angel, my only angel
she's an angel, only angel
she's an angel, my only angel


wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight


she's an angel, only angel
she's an angel, my only angel
she's an angel, my only angel
she is an angel, my-my-my-my only angel

two, three, four


meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway
i just left your bedroom, give me some morphine
is there any more to do?


just let me know, i'll be at the door, at the door
hoping you'll come around
just let me know i'll be on the floor, on the floor
maybe we'll work it out
i gotta get better, gotta get better
i gotta get better, gotta get better
i gotta get better, gotta get better
and maybe we'll work it out


i walked the streets all day, running with the thieves
'cause you left me in the hallway (give me some more)
just take the pain away


just let me know, i'll be at the door, at the door
hoping you'll come around
just let me know, i'll be on the floor, on the floor
maybe we'll work it out
i gotta get better, gotta get better
i gotta get better, gotta get better
i gotta get better, gotta get better
and maybe we'll work it out


we don't talk about it, it's something we don't do
'cause once you go without it, nothing else will do

oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah


she's got a family in carolina
so far away, but she says i remind her of home
feeling oh so far from home
she never saw herself as a west coaster
moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her;
"townes, better swim before you drown"


she's a good girl
she's such a good girl
she's a good girl
she feels so good


she's got a book for every situation
gets into parties without invitations
how could you ever turn her down?
there's not a drink that i think could sink her
how would i tell her that she's all i think about?
well, i guess she just found out


she's a good girl
she's such a good girl
she's a good girl
she feels so good
she feels so good


i met her once and wrote a song about her
i wanna scream, i wanna shout it out
and i hope she hears me now


she's a good girl
she's such a good girl
she's a good girl
feels so good, she feels so good
she feels so good
she feels so good


she's a good girl
she feels so good

gotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
so hard to leave it, that's what i always do
so i keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon


the world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
i heard jenny saying, "go get the kids from school"
and i keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon


i'll be gone too long from you


staring at the ceiling, two weeks and i'll be home
carry the feeling, through paris, all through rome
and i'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon


i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going home
i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going home


quick pause in conversation, she plays songs i've never heard
an old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
and i keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon


i'll be gone too long from you


i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going
i'm going, oh, i'm going home
i'm going, oh, i'm going (i'm going home)
i'm going, oh, i'm going (i'm going home)
i'm going, oh, i'm going home (yeah)
i'm going, oh, i'm going (i'm going home)
i'm going, oh, i'm going (i'm going home)
i'm going, oh, i'm going home (hey)

i got a girl crush
hate to admit it but
i got a heart rush
it ain't slowing down
i got it real bad
want everything she has
that smile and that midnight laugh
she's giving you now


i want to taste her lips
yeah, 'cause they taste like you
i want to drown myself
in a bottle of her perfume
i want her long blonde hair
i want her magic touch
yeah, 'cause maybe then
you'd want me just as much
and i've got a girl crush
i've got a girl crush


i don't get no sleep
i don't get no peace
thinking about her
under your bed sheets
the way that she's whispering
the way that she's pulling you in
lord knows i've tried
i can't get her off my mind


i want to taste her lips
yeah, 'cause they taste like you
i want to drown myself
in a bottle of her perfume
i want her long blonde hair
i want her magic touch
yeah, 'cause maybe then
you'd want me just as much
and i've got a girl crush
oh, and i got a girl crush

maybe, we can
find a place to feel good
and we can treat people with kindness
find a place to feel good


i've got a good feeling
i'm just takin' it all in
floating up and dreamin'
droppin' into the deep end


and if we're here long enough
they'll sing a song for us
and we'll belong


maybe, we can
find a place to feel good
and we can treat people with kindness
find a place to feel good


giving second chances
i don't need all the answers
feeling good in my skin
i just keep on dancin'


and if we're here long enough
we'll see it's all for us
and we'll belong


maybe, we can
find a place to feel good
and we can treat people with kindness
find a place to feel good


and it's just another day (and it's just another day)
and if our friends all pass away (oh-oh, oh-oh)
it's okay (it's okay, it's okay)
it's okay (it's okay, it's okay, yeah)
hey!
here we go now


maybe, we can
find a place to feel good
and we can treat people with kindness
find a place to feel good


all we ever want is automatic all the time
all we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
all we ever want is automatic all the time
all we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
maybe, we can (all together now, one more time)
find a place to feel good (oh yeah)
and we can treat people with kindness (just a little bit of kindness)
find a place to feel good (ow)

solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos
bienvenido al último show
espero que lleves puesta tu mejor ropa
no puedes sobornar la entrada en tu camino al cielo
te ves tan bonita aquí abajo
pero no eres realmente buena


nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes
¿porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
de las balas? de las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes
¿porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
de las balas? de las balas?


solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos
tenemos que escapar de aquí
tenemos que escapar de aquí
solo para tu llanto, todo irá bien
ellos me dijeron que el final estaba cerca
tenemos que escapar de aquí


solo para tu llanto, date el momento de tu vida
rompiendo la atmósfera
las cosas están bastante bien desde aquí
recuerda, toda estará bien
podremos vernos de nuevo en algún lugar
algún lugar lejos de aquí


nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes
¿porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
de las balas? de las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes
¿porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
de las balas? de las balas?

de las balas? de las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos estado aquí antes
¿porque siempre estamos atascados y huyendo
de las balas? de las balas?


no hablamos lo suficiente, deberíamos abrirnos más
antes de que sea demasiado
nunca aprendemos? ya hemos estado aquí antes
es todo lo que sabemos


solo para tu llanto, es la señal de los tiempos
tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar
tenemos que escapar, tenemos que escapar
tenemos que escapar
tenemos que, tenemos que escapar

hello, i’m harry styles, and tonight i’m going to help you drift off to sleep with some soothing words and calming music. a sleep story just for you. with all the business of your day, i know how hard it can be to go to sleep. so, thank you for choosing this story, and me, to help you. i wish you a wonderful night sleep. so make yourself comfortable, take a deep breath in, and then out. in, and then out. and when you’re ready, close your eyes

have you ever wondered what happens when you sleep, where you go and what you feel; the places that you seek? when you start to drift away, your mind becomes a book that writes itself, then fades away before you wake to look

tonight we’re going to think about anything you’d like. so, first let’s visualize some scenes to see us through the night. settle back and clear your mind. we’re heading somewhere special, beyond the world of consciousness, to places more celestial

i’d like you to imagine now you’re there beneath the stars. which, when you pause to think about it, actually you are. as you focus on the darkness right before your eyes, feel the scenes with glinting lights to emulate night skies

think about the things you cherish most and those you love, and then allow yourself to be embraced from up above. the power of the universe meanders through your mind. so, come with me and let’s see what the two of us can find

let’s travel now to moonlit valleys blanketed with heather; the kind of landscape you and i could dream about forever. imagine lazing on the ground, succumbing to the charms of blades of grass we now caress with fingertips and palms

a gentle scent of cedar wood is floating on the breeze; a gift from mother nature and her nearby cedar trees. we’re gazing on the night sky now, marveling at infinity. so, allow your mind to wander to a peaceful, new vicinity

picture this: a rich green forest damp with morning dew. inhale the morning air as we explore, just me and you. leaves create mosaics in every shade of green, as gentle birdsong mingles with the babbling of a stream

dappled sepia sunlight cuts through branches of ahead, as dew drops fall from leaf to leaf, like glistening strands of thread. the dew drops finally coalesce forming satin beads. occasionally they kiss our cheeks. small pleasures; quenching needs

holding hands, we stroll, until we chance upon a brook. its cool, clear water mirroring our faces as we look. a shimmering reflection shows us smiling from above. the world we think but dare not speak, is l-o-v-e; love

now, we snuggle on a raft and drift for endless hours. as willow trees sway in the breeze and blossoms fall in showers. gently swaying to and fro, we look up at the sky and watch the clouds above us forming shapes as they pass by

the wisps of cloud swirl slowly, tinged with tangerine and pink, and as they fade, the sunset give us cause to muse and think of places we should visit and the oceans we could cross. for some who wander through this world, there’s grace in being lost

passing by a waterfall, our thoughts sway to and fro, and time begins to fade and blur beneath the moon’s pale glow. a symphony of tumbling water, lulls and mesmerizes. nature’s soundtracks to our dreams assumes so many geysers

strolling on a sidewalk now, as rain begins to fall. its gentle pitter-patter holds us deep within its thrall. the raindrops rhythm briefly slows, then intensifies. peaceful and benevolent; a gift from moonlit skies

the fragrance the rain creates upon the concrete surface inspires, yet relaxes us and focuses our purpose to shift our minds to neutral and allow our thoughts to drift and recognize the rainfall as a mesmerizing gift

sheltering beneath the porch, we watch the rain pour down. but, now the time has come to leave this dreamy moonlit town. a gentle breeze wafts through the trees, and causes leaves to stir, and then the rain relents and fades as time begins to blur

we find ourselves upon a shoreline, lounging by a lake. all crickets chirp in nearby reeds, it’s hard to stay awake. the scene feels like a watercolor; soft, diluted tones. as looking down we see each other laughing, skimming stones

the stones skip on the gleaming lake and ripples start to form, and though the sun has dipped from view, we feel content and warm. herons drift on thermals, high above the sun-bleached pier, and in the trees beyond the lake, we glimpse a passing deer

strands of cloud unfurl like ribbons in the orange sky. mirrored on the lake now, like a painted butterfly. in the distance, mountains beckon, capped with pristine snow. the kind of sight that dreams evoke when hearts and minds let go

contemplating nothingness, a scene takes shape before us. and as it sharpens in our thoughts, we hear a distant chorus, the dampened sound of silence that only snow can bring, surrounds us with its calming vibes, and touches us within

glistening snowflakes fall in flurries. mountain rivers freeze, the powdery slopes look beautiful, and fresh snow dusts the trees. somehow, now, we’re in a cabin, taking in this view as the fire crackles in the corner just for me and you

we linger for a moment, or maybe it’s been hours for when we blink and look again, our vistas waft in flowers. another destination lulls us; closer now, it seems. perhaps it’s real, or just another chapter in our dreams

drifting in and out of sleep, our thoughts take us elsewhere, to an island fringed by swaying palms, lush beyond compare. a path winds through the mangroves towards a distant beach, that underlines the turquoise ocean. now, within our reach

eventually, we feel the powdery sand right beneath our feet. the sun above now blessing us with gentle, soothing heat. we hear the lilting sound of surf breaking up ahead, while spiral shells and pearly shards determine where we tread

finally, a lapping wave engulfs our sandy feet. it seems to pause and ruminate, then gradually retreat. we dig our toes in cool, wet sand. then, sit and face the sea and let the sound wash over us. alone, just you and me

staring at the nothingness that stretches on forever, our thoughts dovetail and unify in tune, two minds together. as minutes turn to hours, we drift off somewhere new and visualize a stairway to a door we now walk through

imagine now a meadow on a balmy afternoon. birds, and bees, and rustling trees create a summer tune, flanked by fields of sunflowers. hand-in-hand we walk as the gentle sound of nature surrounds us while we talk

the sunflowers give the scenery a warm and golden hue, while hazy sunshine softens our idyllic, rustic view. as we roam past hedgerows, a farmhouse sits alone. its open shutters pressed against uneven walls of stone

a garden winds around the house and daisies poke through grass. a bench that’s lived through countless summers creeks as we walk past. we wonder if the house is empty; once loved, but no longer. the thought of passing time inspires a feeling that grows stronger

this feeling washes over us, lost between a sight. and as the sun begins to set, we stop and wonder why gravity caresses us and pulls you close to me. then, the scene begins to fade on new reality

deeper, gradually deeper, we drift and now transcend to unfamiliar places. too surreal to comprehend. slowly, we capitulate, as sleep begins to call. entwined in dreams and shifting scenes, we drift and gently fall

friendly faces, glorious places, things we hope to do; intertwined with snapshots. some of me, and some of you. moonlit valleys, verdant forests, gazing at the ocean, summer meadows, tranquil sunsets, steeped in pure emotion

the tenderness we feel when we are close, two minds as one, surrounds us and connects us. but, we’ve only just begun. for now, we dream together of all that is to follow. and now that sleep will keep us safe, for now until tomorrow

maybe all the memories that we’ve gathered here tonight are all dreams now remembered, or wishes in plain sight. no matter what, they’re with us now, for this night and forever. and every time we close our eyes, they’re yours and mine to treasure

goodnight, and sleep well

i took my love, i took it down
i climbed a mountain and i turned around
and i saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
'till the landslide brought me down
oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
can the child within my heart rise above?
can i sail through the changing ocean tides?
can i handle the seasons of my life?


well, i've been afraid of changing
'cause i've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
even children get older
and i'm getting older too
yes, i'm getting older too

you're insecure, don't know what for
you're turning heads when you walk through the door
don't need makeup to cover up
being the way that you are is enough


everyone else in the room can see it
everyone else but you


baby you light up my world like nobody else
the way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
but when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
you don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful


so c-come on, you got it wrong
to prove i'm right i put it in a song
i don't know why you're being shy
and turn away when i look into your eyes


everyone else in the room can see it
everyone else but you


baby you light up my world like nobody else
the way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
but when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
you don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
if only you saw what i can see
you'll understand why i want you so desperately
right now i'm looking at you and i can't believe

who's that shadow holding me hostage?
i've been here for days
who's this whisper telling me that i'm never gonna get away?
i know they'll be coming to find me soon

being held by you

who's this man that's holding your hand
and talking about your eyes?
used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind
i know they'll be coming to find me soon
but my stockholm syndrome is in your room
yeah, i fell for you

i had a couple seeds and made a forest
i put in the work and take the profit

rule number two, don't make the promise
if you can't keep the deal then just be honest (ayy)
i could never die, i'm chuck norris
fuck the government and fuck boris
i'm a villain, killin' when i'm barrin'

all this flyin' overseas is always fuckin' up my body clock
and all this stress has got me wreckin' up my brain (ayy, ayy)
so tell these likkle fishes back up off my name (ayy, ayy)
i ain't gotta be a rapper with a chain
cah the rules are kinda different when you're baddin' up the game, straight
baddin' up the game, bad it up again
had 'em up before, have 'em up again (ayy)
fake bruddas, man, your mandem all pretend
pussy by himself, he's badder with his friends, aww
you man are so insecure, man, it's a joke (man, it's a joke)
i need a ballon d'or, 'cause i'm the goat (still the goat)
if you believe in your sauce then raise a toast (raise a toast)
these are some genius thoughts so make the most
told her "save me some"
i need all the homage, could you pay me some?
man a droppin' bangers on your baby mums
gyal say i'm rude, they wanna see me nude
my name stiff chocolate, i got nothing left to prove
i got holes in my lapel, rubbin' shoulders with your girl
which one of **** said that i would go to jail?
well, i guess you have to hold a l
tell 'em "this is london city, we the hottest in the world"
what we tellin' em? look

after the gold rush, there ain't no reason to stay
shoulda learned from the movies that good guys don't run away
but roads weren't made to not go down
and there ain't room for both of us in this town


so you can have your space, cowboy
i ain't gonna fence you in
go on, ride away in your silverado
i'll see you around again
'cause i know my place, and it ain't with you
sunsets fade, and love does, too
we had our day in the sun
when a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
so you can have your space


you can have your space, cowboy
i ain't gonna fence you in
go on, ride away in your silverado
i'll see you around again
'cause i know my place, and it ain't with you
sunsets fade, and love does, too
though we had our day in the sun
when a horse wants to run, ain't no sense in closing the gate
you can have your space
yeah, you can have your space
you can have your space, cowboy

yeah


you can have a steam train
if you'd just lay down your tracks
you can have an airplane flying
if you bring your blue sky back
all you do is call me
i'll be anything you need


you could have a big dipper
going up and down, and around the bends
you could have a bumper car, bumping
the amusement never ends


i want to be your sledgehammer
call my name
let me be your sledgehammer
this will be my testimony
sledge sledge


show me round your fruit cakes
'cause i will be your honey bee
open up your fruit cakes
where the fruit is as sweet as can be


i'm gonna be your sledgehammer
why don't you call my name
call sledgehammer
put your mind at rest
i'm going to be the sledgehammer
this can be my testimony
i'm your sledgehammer
there be no doubt about it


sledge
sledge
sledge


i kicked the habit (kicked the habit, kicked the habit)
shed my skin (shed my skin)
this is the new stuff (this is the new stuff)
i go dancing in (we go dancing in)
won't you show for me (show for me)
i will show for you (show for you)
will you show for me (show for me)
i will show for you
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, coming through
gotta feel that power
gonna feel that rhythm
gotta feel that rhythm
i've been feeding the rhythm
i've been feeding the rhythm
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you
(show for me, show for me)
come on, come on, help me through
sledge
i confess that i was lost before
the lights made me lose my direction
my aching heart now riots, rules my actions
i sense your ignorance, voiceless,i cannot move on

don't let this love fall again down
i don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
i adore getting grabbed by your attention
and i'm desperate to feel your devotion

be my umbrella in the burning rain
catch my tears and keep me safe
i only want to feel pain when you agree with it
you are my saviour, far from my enemy

don't let this love fall again down
i don’t wanna feel again like on a high rope
i adore getting grabbed by your attention
and i'm desperate to feel your devotion

and my love, when i hear your soft voice
my spine is burning to ashes and the lust grows
i wanna be real with you, baby
because you're making my life having goals

don't let this love fall again down
i don't wanna feel again like on a high rope
i adore getting grabbed by your attention
and i'm desperate to feel your devotion

baby, you'll come knocking on my front door
same old line you used to use before
i said yeah, well what am supposed to do?
i didn't know what i was getting into


so you've had a little trouble in town
so you're keeping some demons down
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around


and jt's hard to think about what you've wanted
it's hard to think about what you've lost
oo this doesn't have to be the big get even
this doesn't have to be anything at all


i know you really wanna tell me goodbye
i know you really wanna be your own girl


baby, you could never look me in the eye
yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around
oh yeah yeah




well there's people running 'round loose in the world
ain't got nothing better to do
oo they make a meal of some bright-eyed kid
oo you need someone looking after you


i know you really wanna tell me goodbye
i know you really wanna be your own girl


baby, you could never look me in the eye
yeah, you buckle with the weight of the words
stop draggin' my, stop draggin' my
stop draggin' my heart around
oh yeah yeah


stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around
stop draggin' my heart around

is love so fragile and the heart so hollow
shatter with words impossible to follow
you're saying i’m fragile, i try not to be
i search only for something i can't see
'cause i have my own life
and i am stronger than you know


but i carry this feeling
when you walked into my house
that you won’t be walking out the door
still i carry this feeling
when you walked into my house
that you won't be walking out the door


lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace


you in the moonlight
with your sleepy eyes
could you ever love a man like me
and you were right
when i walked into your house
i knew i'd never want to leave


sometimes i'm a strong man
sometimes cold and scared
sometimes i cry
but that time i saw you
i knew with you to light my nights
somehow i'd get by
first time i saw you
i knew with you to light my nights
somehow i would get by


lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace
lovers forever, face to face
my city, your mountains
stay with me, stay
i need you to love me
i need you today
give to me your leather
take from me my lace
take from me my lace
take from me my lace

{to the melody of two ghosts}


same orange face, same background blue
same white shirt, couple more less words
and it's her, but it's also her
sounds so strange, looks so weird
seems like something she used to be
but she can't touch what she sees


she's not who she used to be
she's not who she used to be
she's just two ghost arguing with herself, so let it be
trying to remember how it feels to be zayn


the phone light washеs this room white
the text rеflection in your good side
the autocorrect is all she needs
tied to her phone is all she's known
telling those stories she already told
cause she tells them on repeat


she's not who she used to be
she's not who she used to be
she's just two ghost arguing with herself, so let it be
she's not who she used to be
she's not who she used to be
she's just two ghosts standing in the place of her and her
trying to remember how it feels to be zayn


she's not who she used to be
she's not who she used to be
she's just two ghost arguing with herself, so let it be
she's not who she used to be
she don't see what she used to see
she's just two ghosts standing in the place of her and her
trying to remember how it feels to be zayn


trying to remember how it feels to be zayn

she's just trying to remember how it feels to be zayn

don’t know where you’re laying

don’t know what i’d tell you if
i passed you on the street


i don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
oh! (oh, louis!)
every time i see your face, there’s only so much i can take
oh! (oh, louis!)


don’t know how you taste when
there’s smoke in your perfume
chew me up and spit me out
nothing left to lose


i don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
oh! (oh, louis!)
every time i see your face, there’s only so much i can take
oh! (oh, louis!)

i don’t know what i’d tell you if
you asked me for the truth


i don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
oh, louis! (oh, louis!)
every time i see your face, there’s only so much i can take
oh, louis! (oh, louis!)


well i guess it would be nice if i could touch your body
if i could touch your body
if i could touch your body
if i could touch your body


i don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
oh, louis! (oh, louis!)
every time i see your face, there’s only so much i can take
oh, louis! (oh, louis!)

just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
welcome to the final show
hope you're wearing your best clothes
you can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
you look pretty good down here
but you ain't really good


we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?
we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?


just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
just stop your crying, it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here


just stop your crying, have the time of your life
breaking through the atmosphere
and things are pretty good from here
remember everything will be alright
we can meet again somewhere
somewhere far away from here


we never learn, we been here before
why are we always stuck and running from
the bullets? the bullets?


just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away from here
we gotta get away from here
stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
they told me that the end is near
we gotta get away from here


we don't talk enough, we should open up
before it's all too much
will we ever learn? we've been here before
it's just what we know


stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
we gotta get away, we got to get away
we got to get away, we got to get away
we got to get away

reúnete conmigo en el pasillo
reúnete conmigo en el pasillo
acabo de dejar la habitación
dame algo de morfina
¿hay algo más que se pueda hacer?


solo házmelo saber, yo estaré a la puerta, a la puerta
esperando que vengas
solo házmelo saber, yo estaré en el piso, en el piso
tal vez podamos resolverlo
tengo que mejorarme, tengo quе mejorar
tengo que mеjorarme, tengo que mejorar
tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar
y tal vez podamos resolverlo


caminé por las calles todo el día
corriendo con los ladrones
porque me dejaste en el pasillo (dame algo más)
solo aleja el dolor


solo házmelo saber, yo estaré a la puerta, a la puerta
esperando que vengas
solo házmelo saber, yo estaré en el piso, en el piso
tal vez podamos resolverlo
tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar
tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar
tengo que mejorarme, tengo que mejorar
y tal vez podamos resolverlo


no hablamos sobre ello
es algo que no hacemos
porque una vez que lo dejas
no hay nada que pueda llenarte

solo detén tu llanto
es una señal de los tiempos
bienvenida al espectáculo final
espero que lleves tus mejores ropas
no puedes sobornar al portero
cuando vayas de camino hacia el cielo
te ves muy bien aquí abajo
pero en verdad no eres buena


nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?


solo detén tu llanto, es una señal de los tiempos
tenemos que escapar de aquí
tenemos que escapar de aquí
solo detén tu llanto, todo irá bien
me dijeron que el fin está cerca
tenemos que escapar de aquí


solo detén tu llanto, pásatelo mejor que nunca
atravesando la atmósfera
y las cosas están bastante bien desde aquí
recuerda que todo irá bien
podemos vernos de nuevo en algún sitio
en algún sitio muy lejos de aquí


nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?


solo detén tu llanto, es una señal de los tiempos
tenemos que escapar de aquí
tenemos que escapar de aquí
solo detén tu llanto, todo irá bien
me dijeron que el fin está cerca
tenemos que escapar de aquí


nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?
nunca aprendemos, ya hemos pasado por esto
¿por qué siempre nos atascamos y escapamos
de las balas, las balas?


no hablamos lo suficiente
deberíamos abrirnos de par en par
antes de que todo sea demasiado
¿aprenderemos alguna vez?
ya hemos pasado por esto antes
es solo lo que conocemos


detén tu llanto, cariño, es una señal de los tiempos
tenemos que escaparnos, tenemos que escaparnos
tenemos que escaparnos, tenemos que escaparnos
tenemos que escapar
llegamos, tenemos que, lejos
llegamos, tenemos que, lejos
llegamos, tenemos que, lejos

oh, sí..


ella tiene a la familia en carolina
tan lejos, pero dice que le recuerdo a su hogar
sintiéndose, oh, tan lejos del hogar
nunca se vio a sí misma como alguien de la costa oeste
se mudó porque se lo dijo su abuela
"townes, mejor que nades antes de ahogarte"


ella es una buena chica
ella es tan buena chica
ella es una buena chica
ella te hace sentir tan bien


tiene un libro para cada situación
va a fiestas sin invitación
¿cómo podrías rеchazarla?
no hay bebida alguna
que yo creo pudiеra hundirla
¿cómo le diría que ella es en lo único en lo que pienso?
bueno, supongo que lo acaba de descubrir


ella es una buena chica
ella es tan buena chica
ella es una buena chica
ella te hace sentir tan bien
ella te hace sentir tan bien


la conocí una vez y escribí una canción sobre ella
quiero gritar, sí
quiero gritarlo a los cuatro vientos
y espero que ahora ella me oiga


ella es una buena chica
ella es tan buena chica
ella es una buena chica
ella te hace sentir tan bien
ella te hace sentir tan bien
ella te hace sentir tan bien
ella te hace sentir tan bien
oh, ella es una buena chica
ella te hace sentir tan bien


ella es una buena chica
ella te hace sentir tan bien

dulce criatura
tuvimos otra charla sobre lo que está fallando
pero todavía somos jóvenes
no sabemos a dónde vamos
pero sabemos cuál es el lugar al que pertenecemos


no, empezamos
dos corazones en un hogar
es difícil cuando discutimos
ambos somos testarudos
lo sé, pero oh


dulce criatura, dulce criatura
allá donde voy, tú me traes a casa
dulce criatura, dulce criatura
cuando me quedo sin carretera
tú me traes a casa


dulce criatura
corríamos cruzando el jardín
oh, donde nada nos molestaba
pero todavía somos jóvеnes
yo siempre piеnso en ti
y en cómo no hablamos lo suficiente


no, empezamos
dos corazones en un hogar
lo sé, es difícil, discutimos
ambos somos testarudos
lo sé, pero oh


dulce criatura, dulce criatura
allá donde voy, tú me traes a casa
dulce criatura, dulce criatura
cuando me quedo sin carretera
tú me traes a casa


y, oh, cuando empezamos
dos corazones en un hogar
se hace más difícil cuando discutimos
ambos somos testarudos
lo sé, pero oh


dulce criatura, dulce criatura
allá donde voy, tú me traes a casa
dulce criatura, dulce criatura
cuando me quedo sin carretera
tú me traes a casa
tú me traerás a casa
sign of the times"
το σημαδι της ζωης μας

just stop your crying
σταματα να δακρυζεις
it's a sign of the times
αυτα ειναι τα σημαδια της ζωης μας
welcome to the final show
καλοσωρισες στην τελικη επιδειξη
hope you're wearing your best clothes
ελπιζω να φορας τα καλυτερα σου ρουχα

you can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
δεν μπορεις να κοροιδεψεις την πορτα προς στον ουρανο
you look pretty good down here
φαινεσαι πολυ καλα εκει κατω
but you ain't really good
αλλα δεν φαινεσαι τοσο καλα

we never learn, we've been here before
εμεις ποτε δεν μαθαμε εαν ειμασταν απο πριν εδω
why are we always stuck and running from
γιατι ειμαστε παντα σταματημενοι και τρεχουμε απο
the bullets, the bullets?
την σφαιρα την σφαιρα?
we never learn, we've been herе before
εμεις ποτε δεν θα μαθουμε εαν ειμασταν πριν εδω
why are wе always stuck and running from
γιατι εμεις παντα μενουμε κολλημενοι και τρεχουμε απο
your bullets, the bullets?
την γη την σφαιρα σου?

just stop your crying
σταματα να δακρυζεις
it's a sign of the times
ειναι ενα σημαδι απο τον χρονο
we gotta get away from here
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε απο εδω
we gotta get away from here
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε απο εδω
just stop your crying
μολις σταματησεις να δακρυζεις
it'll be alright
θα ειμαστε ενταξει
they told me that the end is near
αυτοι μου ειπαν οτι το τελος ειναι κοντα
we gotta get away from here
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε απο εδω

just stop your crying
μολις σταματησεις να δακρυζεις
have the time of your life
εχει τον χρονο απο την ζωη
breaking through the atmosphere
διασχιζοντας την ατμοσφαιρα
and things are pretty good from here
ολα τα πραγματα φαινονται ομορφα απο εδω

remember, everything will be alright
να θυμασαι οτι ολα θα ειναι ενταξει
we can meet again somewhere
εμεις μπορει να ξανασυναντηθουμε καπου
somewhere far away from here
καπου πιο μακρυα απο εδω

we never learn, we've been here before
εμεις δεν προκειται ποτε να μαθουμε εαν ειμασταν απο πριν εδω
why are we always stuck and running from
ειμαστε παντοτε κολλημενοι και τρεχουμε απο
the bullets, the bullets?
την σφαιρα την σφαιρα
we never learn, we've been here before
εμεις ποτε δεν θα μαθουμε εαν ειμασταν απο πριν εδω
why are we always stuck and running from
γιατι εμεις ειμαστε κολλημενοι και τρεχουμε απο

baby, it'll be alright
μωρο μου θα ειμαστε ενταξει
they told me that the end is near
μου ειπαν οτι το τελος πλησιαζει
we gotta get away from here
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε

we never learn, we've been here before
εμεις ποτε δεν θα μαθουμε εαν ειμασταν εδω απο πριν
why are we always stuck and running from
εμεις ειμαστε παντοτε κολλημενοι και τρεχουμε απο
the bullets, the bullets?
την σφαιρα την σφαιρα?

γιατι εμεις ειμαστε παντοτε κολλημενοι και τρεχουμε απο
your bullets, the bullets?
την σφαιρα την σφαιρα?

we don't talk enough
εμεις δεν μιλαμε αρκετα
we should open up
θα επρεπε να ανοιχτουμε
before it's all too much
πριν φαινοταν ολα πολλα
will we ever learn?
θα μαθουμε ποτε?
we've been here before
εαν εχουμε ερθει εδω πριν
it's just what we know
ειναι το μονο που εμεις γνωριζουμε

stop your crying, baby
σταματα να δακρυζεις μωρο μου
it's a sign of the times
ειναι τα σημαδια της ζωης μας
we gotta get away
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε μακρυα
we got to get away
εμεις προκειται να φυγουμε μακρυα
we got to get away
we got to get away
we got to get away
we got to—we got to—away
we got to—we got to—away
we got to—we got to—away
