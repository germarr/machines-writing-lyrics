have you got colour in your cheeks?
do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
are there some aces up your sleeve?
have you no idea that you're in deep?
i've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
how many secrets can you keep?
'cause there's this tune i found
that makes me think of you somehow an' i play it on repeat
until i fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee
(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawlin' back to you
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few?
'cause i always do
maybe i'm too
busy bein' yours
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you
so have you got the guts?
been wonderin' if your heart's still open
and if so, i wanna know what time it shuts
simmer down an' pucker up, i'm sorry to interrupt
it's just i'm constantly on the cusp of tryin' to kiss you
i don't know if you feel the same as i do
but we could be together if you wanted to
(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)
ever thought of callin' when
you've had a few? (had a few)
'cause i always do ('cause i always do)
maybe i'm too (maybe i’m too busy)
busy bein' yours (bein' yours)
to fall for somebody new
now, i've thought it through
crawlin' back to you
(do i wanna know?) if this feelin' flows both ways?
(sad to see you go) was sorta hopin' that you’d stay
(baby, we both know) that the nights were mainly made
for sayin' things that you can't say tomorrow day
(do i wanna know?) too busy bein' yours to fall
(sad to see you go) ever thought of callin', darlin'?
(do i wanna know?) do you want me crawlin' back to you?
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
in my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs
stop and wait a sec
when you look at me like that, my darling, what did you expect?
i'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
or i did last time i checked
not shy of a spark
the knife twists at the thought that i should fall short of the mark
frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
the middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five-minute drive
in my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs
but i crumble completely when you cry
it seems like once again you've had to greet me with "goodbye"
i'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
take my hands off of your eyes too soon
i'm going back to 505
if it's a seven-hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
in my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
with your hands between your thighs and a smile
you used to get it in your fishnets
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
nothing seems as pretty as the past though
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
remember when you used to be a rascal?
oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
flicking through a little book of sex tips
remember when the boys were all electric?
now when she's told she's gonna get it
i'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it
clinging to not getting sentimental
said she wasn't going but she went still
likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
was it a mecca dauber or a betting pencil?
oh, the boy's a slag, the best you ever had
the best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
weren't as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
my love, when you dream them up
oh, flo, where did you go?
where did you go? where did you go?
you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
just sounding it out
but you're not coming back again
you're falling about
you took a left off last laugh lane
you were just sounding it out
but you're not coming back again
you used to get it in your fishnets
(falling about)
now you only get it in your night dress
discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
(you took a left off last laugh lane)
landed in a very common crisis
everything's in order in a black hole
(you were just sounding it out)
is anything as pretty in the past though?
that bloody mary's lacking in tabasco
(you're not coming back again)
remember when you used to be a rascal?
(oh...)
arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
an' a helter skelter 'round her little finger
an' i ride it endlessly
she's got a barbarella silver swimsuit
an' when she needs to shelter from reality
she takes a dip in my daydreams
my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella, oh
as arabella
just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
arabella's got a '70s head
but she's a modern lover
it's an exploration, she's made of outer space
an' her lips are like the galaxy's edge
an' her kiss the colour of a constellation
fallin' into place
my days end best when the sunset gets itself behind
that little lady sittin' on the passenger side
it's much less picturesque without her catchin' the light
the horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
as arabella, oh
as arabella
just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
(that's magic) in a cheetah print coat
(just a slip) underneath it, i hope
(asking if) i can have one of those
(organic) cigarettes that she smokes
(wraps her lips) 'round a mexican coke
(makes you wish) that you were the bottle
(takes a sip) of your soul, an' it sounds like
just might’ve tapped into your mind and soul
you can't be sure
i wanna be your vacuum cleaner
breathin' in your dust
i wanna be your ford cortina
i will never rust
if you like your coffee hot
let me be your coffee pot
you call the shots, babe
i just wanna be yours
secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
let me be your 'leccy meter
an' i'll never run out
let me be the portable heater
that you’ll get cold without
i wanna be your setting lotion (wanna be)
hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
at least as deep as the pacific ocean
i wanna be yours
secrets i have held in my heart
are harder to hide than i thought
maybe i just wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
i wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
wanna be yours
i wanna be your vacuum cleaner (wanna be yours)
breathin' in your dust (wanna be yours)
i wanna be your ford cortina (wanna be yours)
i will never rust (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i just wanna be yours (wanna be yours)
i'm a puppet on a string
tracy island, time-traveling
diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
come to find you four in some velvet morning
years too late, she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine?
are you mine?
are you mine? woah, ah
i guess what i'm trying to say is i need the deep end
keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
great escape, lost track of time and space
she's a silver lining climbing on my desire
and i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine, mine?)
and the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
so in case, i'm mistaken, i
just wanna hear you say, "you got me, baby
are you mine?"
she's a silver lining
lone ranger riding through an open space
in my mind when she's not right there beside me
i go crazy 'cause here isn't where i wanna be
and satisfaction feels like a distant memory
and i can't help myself, all i
wanna hear her say is "are you mine?"
well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
(or just mine tonight?)
the mirror's image tells me it's home time
but i'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
and as i arrived i thought i saw you leavin'
carryin' your shoes
decided that once again i was just dreamin'
of bumpin' into you
now, it's three in the mornin'
and i'm tryna' change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message, you reply
"why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"high, why'd you only call me when you're high?"
somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
i need a partner, well are you out tonight?
it's harder and harder to get you to listen
more i get through the gears
incapable of makin' alright decisions
and having bad ideas
now, it's three in the mornin'
and i'm tryna' change your mind
left you multiple missed calls
and to my message, you reply (message, you reply)
"why'd you only call me when you're high?"
(why'd you only call me when you're)
"high, why'd you only call me when you're high?"
and i can't see you here, wonder where i might
it sort of feels like i'm runnin' out of time
i haven't found all i was hopin' to find
you said you got to be up in the mornin'
gonna have an early night
and you're startin' to bore me, baby
"why'd you only call me when you're high?"
"why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?"
"why'd you only ever phone me when you're (high)?"
you got the lights on in the afternoon
an' the nights are drawn out long
and you’re kissin' to cut through the gloom
with a cough drop coloured tongue
and you were sittin' in the corner with the coats, all piled high
and i thought you might be mine
in a small world on an exceptionally rainy tuesday night
in the right place and time
when the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
when you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks
well, you cured my january blues
yeah, you made it all alright
i got a feelin' i might have lit the very fuse
that you were tryin' not to light
you were a stranger in my phonebook i was actin' like i knew
‘cause i had nothin' to lose
when the winter’s in full swing
and your dreams just aren’t comin' true
ain’t it funny what you’ll do?
when the zeros line up on the 24-hour clock
when you know who’s callin' even though the number is blocked
when you walked around your house wearin' my sky blue lacoste
and your knee socks
the late afternoon, the ghost in your room
that you always thought didn’t approve of you knockin' boots
never stopped you lettin' me get hold of the sweet spot
by the scruff of your knee socks
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (could be my baby)
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (could be my baby)
all the zeros lined up
but the number’s blocked
when you’ve come undone
you and me could have been a team
each had a half of a king and queen seat
like the beginning of mean streets
you could be my baby (could be my baby)

so you're on the prowl wondering whether
she left already or not
leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
never knowing when to stop
sunglasses indoors, par for the course
lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
cages and poles
call off the search for your soul
or put it on hold again
she's having a sly indoor smoke
and she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
as all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
and it seems as though those lumps in your throat
that you just swallowed have got you going
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
she's a certified mind blower
knowing full well that i don't
may suggest there's somewhere from which i might know her
just to get the ball to roll
drunken monologues, confused because
it's not like i'm falling in love, i just want ya
to do me no good
and you look like you could
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
number one party anthem
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem, yeah, yeah
the look of love, the rush of blood
the "she's with me"s, the gallic shrug
the shutterbugs, the camera plus
the black & white and the color dodge
the good time girls, the cubicles
the house of fun, the number one
party anthem, oh
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
come on, come on, come on
before the moment's gone
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
number one party anthem
yeah, yeah
i just wanted to be one of the strokes
now look at the mess you made me make
hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
i'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
but golden boy's in bad shape
i found out the hard way that
here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
everybody's on a barge
floating down the endless stream of great tv
1984, 2019
maybe i was a little too wild in the '70s
rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
karate bandana, warp speed chic
hair down to there, impressive moustache
love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
let's all have a swig and do a hot lap
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
it took the light forever to get to your eyes
i just wanted to be one of those ghosts
you thought that you could forget
and then i haunt you via the rear view mirror
on a long drive from the back seat
but it's alright, 'cause you love me
and you recognise that it ain't how it should be
your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
so pull over, i know the place
don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
what exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
jukebox in the corner, "long hot summer"
they've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
what do you mean you've never seen blade runner?
oh, maybe i was a little too wild in the '70s
back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
elevator down to my make-believe residency
from the honeymoon suite
two shows a day, four nights a week
easy money
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
so who you gonna call?
the martini police
oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
it took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes
and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
it's the star treatment
it's the star treatment
the star treatment
what's been happenin' in your world?
what have you been up to?
i heard that you fell in love or near enough
i gotta tell you the truth, yeah
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feelin' i left it too late, but, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
i'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it
forever isn't for everyone
is forever for you?
it sounds like settlin' down or givin' up
but it don't sound much like you, girl
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feelin' i left it too late, but, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
i'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it
under a spell, you're hypnotised (ooh)
darling, how could you be so blind? (snap out of it)
under a spell, you're hypnotised (ooh)
darling, how could you be so blind?
i wanna grab both your shoulders and shake, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
i get the feelin' i left it too late, but, baby
snap out of it (snap out of it)
if that watch don't continue to swing
or the fat lady fancies havin' a sing
i'll be here, waitin' ever so patiently for you to
snap out of it
jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
i've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
where i ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark
hoo
good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please, tell me, how may i direct your call?
this magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
mama wants some answers
do you remember where it all went wrong?
technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
kiss me underneath the moon's side boob
good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please, tell me, how may i direct your call?
and do you celebrate your dark side
then wish you'd never left the house?
have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?
hoo
good afternoon
tranquility base hotel and casino
mark speaking
please, tell me, how may i direct your call?
your love is like a studded leather headlock
your kiss, it could put creases in the rain
you're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
and those other girls are just post-mix lemonade
suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i am a fool for you
i poured my aching heart into a pop song
i couldn't get the hang of poetry
that's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
and i can only hope you've got it aimed at me
suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i am a fool for
blue moon girls from once upon a shangri-la
how i often wonder where you are
you have got that face that just says
"baby, i was made to break your heart", oh-oh-oh
suck it and see, you never know
sit next to me before i go, go, go, go
jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
be cruel to me 'cause i am a fool for you
one for the road, oooh oooh
one for the road, oooh oooh
from the bottom of your heart
the relegation zone
i saw this comin' from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
the cracks in blackout blinds
cast patterns on the ceiling
but you're feeling fine
i thought it was dark outside
i thought it was dark outside
one for the road
so we all get back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me 'round, baby
i feel like i've been here before
i've been wonderin' whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?
i knew this would be on the cards
i knew you wouldn't fold
i saw this comin' from the start
the shake, rattle and roll
one for the road
so we all get back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me 'round, baby
i feel like i've been here before
i've been wonderin' whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?
the mixture hits you hard
don't get that sinking feeling
don't fall apart
some out of tune guitar
soundtrack to disaster
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh, one for the road
oooh oooh
oooh oooh
oooh oooh
oooh oooh
one for the road
so we all get back to yours
and you sit and talk to me on the floor
there's no need to show me 'round, baby
i feel like i've been here before
i've been wonderin' whether later
when you tell everybody to go
will you pour me one for the road?
i thought i saw you in the battleship
but it was only a look-a-like
she was nothing but a vision trick
under the warning light
she was close, close enough to be your ghost
but my chances turned to toast
when i asked her if i could call her your name
i thought i saw you in the rusty hook
huddled up in a wicker chair
i wandered over for a closer look
and kissed whoever was sitting there
she was close, and she held me very tightly
'til i asked awfully politely
"please, can i call you her name?"
and i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself
i thought i saw you in the parrot's beak
messing with the smoke alarm
it was too loud for me to hear her speak
and she had a broken arm
it was close, so close that the walls were wet
and she wrote it out in letraset
"no, you can't call me her name"
tell me, where's your hiding place?
i'm worried i'll forget your face
and i've asked everyone
i'm beginning to think i imagined you all along
i elongated my lift home
yeah, i let him go the long way round
i smelt your scent on the seatbelt
and kept my shortcuts to myself
i saw your sister in the cornerstone
on the phone to the middle man
when i saw that she was on her own
i thought she might understand
she was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
she said, "i'm really not supposed to, but yes
you can call me anything you want"
outside the cafe by the cracker factory
you were practicing a magic trick
and my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
on the last of your pick and mix
said, "you're mistaken if you're thinking
that i haven't been called cold before"
as you bit into your strawberry lace
and then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
it's all you had left and it was going to waste
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i love that little game you had called crying lightning
and how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
on rainy afternoons
the next time that i caught my own reflection
it was on its way to meet you
thinking of excuses to postpone
you never looked like yourself from the side
but your profile could not hide
the fact you knew i was approaching your throne
with folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
and though i tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
there was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
and your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called crying lightning
and how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
crying lightning
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called
crying lightning, crying lightning
crying lightning, crying lightning
your pastimes consisted of the strange
and twisted and deranged
and i hate that little game you had called crying
well, now then, mardy bum
i've seen your frown and it's like looking down
the barrel of a gun, and it goes off
and out come all these words
oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
a side i much prefer
it's one that laughs and jokes around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up, and away
ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
well, now then mardy bum
oh, i'm in trouble again, aren't i?
i thought as much
'cause you turned over there
pulling that silent disappointment face
the one that i can't bear
well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up, and away
ah, but it's reight hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
and yeah, i'm sorry i was late
but i missed the train and then the traffic was a state
and i can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs
oh, when you say i don't care
but, of course i do, yeah, i clearly do
so laugh and joke around
remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
to get things off the ground
and it was up, up, and away
oh, but it's reight hard to remember that
on a day like today
when you're all argumentative
and you've got the face on
dancing in my underpants
i'm gonna run for government
i'm gonna form a covers band anorl (stop)
back there by the baby grand
did mr. winter wonderland
say, "come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
i fantasise, i call it quits
i swim with the economists
and i get to the bottom of it for good
by the time reality hits
the chimes of freedom fell to bits
the shining city on the fritz
they come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (stop)
oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
and you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
multiplied by five
i suppose a singer must die
"singsong 'round the money tree"
this stunning documentary
that no one else unfortunately saw
such beautiful photography
it's worth it for the opening scene
i've been driving 'round listening to the score
or maybe i just imagined it all
i've played to quiet rooms like this before
bear with me, man, i lost my train of thought
i can't explain but i wanna try
there's this image of you and i
and it goes dancing by
in the morning and in the night time
there's all these secrets that i can't keep
like in my heart there's that hotel suite
and you lived there so long
it's kind of strange now you're gone
i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
there's all those places we used to go
and i suspect you already know
but that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
but something about it's changed
i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
and i thought i was yours forever
or maybe i was mistaken
but i just cannot manage to make it through the day
without thinking of you lately
i'm not sure if i should show you what i've found
has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
isn't it hard to make up your mind
when you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
i said, who's that girl there?
i wonder what went wrong so that she had to roam the streets
she don't do major credit cards, i doubt she does receipts
it's all not quite legitimate
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance, i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a driving ban
amongst some other offences
and i've seen him with girls of the night
and he told roxanne to put on her red light
they're all infected but he'll be alright
'cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
i said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?
although you're trying not to listen
avert your eyes and staring at the ground
she makes a subtle proposition
"i'm sorry, love, i'll have to turn you down"
and oh, he must be up to summat
what are the chances? sure it's more than likely
i've got a feeling in my stomach
and start to wonder what his story might be
what his story might be, yeah
'cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here
look, here comes a ford mondeo
isn't he mr. inconspicuous?
and he don't even have to say owt
she's in the stance ready to get picked up
bet she's delighted when she sees him
pulling in and giving her the eye
because she must be fucking freezing
scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
it don't stop in the winter, no
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here
well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
over the river, going out of town
and they said it changes when the sun goes down
around here, around here, oh
and what a scummy man
just give him half a chance, i bet he'll rob you if he can
can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
i hope you're not involved at all
stop making the eyes at me
i'll stop making the eyes at you
what it is that surprises me
is that i don't really want you to
and your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh
i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984
i wish you'd stop ignoring me
because it's sending me to despair
without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
and i don't think it's very fair
that your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
your name isn't rio, but i don't care for sand
and lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh
i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
well, from 1984
and no, there in't no love
no montagues or capulets
just banging tunes and dj sets and
dirty dancefloors and dreams of naughtiness
well, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
i don't know if you're looking for romance or
i don't know what you're looking for
i said, i bet that you look good on the dancefloor
dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
said, from 1984
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
the punchline before they have told the joke
plenty of desperation to be seen
staring at the television screen
they've sped up to the point where they provoke
you to tell the fucking punchline before you have told the joke
well sorry, sunshine, it doesn't exist
it wasn't in the top 100 list
and it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told you, but you were dying for it
she saw it and she grabbed it and it wasn't what it seemed
the kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
another variation on a theme
a tangle on the television and the magazine
d'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
d'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath
that says that "we are defenders of any poser
or professional pretender around"
and when did your list replace the twist and turn
like a fist replaced a kiss?
don't concern us with your bollocks, i don't want your prayer
save it for the morning after
and it's the thousandth time that it's even bolder
don't be surprised when you get bent over
they told you, but you were gagging for it
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
let's have a game on the teddy picker
not quick enough, can i have it quicker?
already thick and you're getting thicker
presuming that all things are equal
who'd want to be men of the people
when there's people like you?
still got pictures of friends on the wall
i suppose we aren't really friends anymore
maybe i shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
get freaked out from a knock at the door
when i haven't been expecting one
and didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
we'll be there at the back of the bar
in a booth like we usually were
every time there was a rocket launch or some big event
what a death i died writing that song
start to finish, with you looking on
it stays between us, steinway, and his sons
'cause it's the ultracheese
perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
dressed like a fictional character
from a place they called america in the golden age
trust the politics to come along
when you were just tryna orbit the sun
when you were just about to be kind to someone
because you had the chance
i've still got pictures of friends on the wall
i might look as if i'm deep in thought
but the truth is i'm probably not
if i ever was
oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
i've done some things that i shouldn't have done
but i haven't stopped loving you once
well, the mourning was complete
when there was tears on the steering wheel dripping on the seat
several hours or several weeks
i'd have the cheek to say they're equally as bleak
it's the beginning of the end
the car went up the hill and disappeared around the bend
ask anyone, they'll tell you that it's these times that it tends
to start to break in half, to start to fall apart, hold on to your heart
and do me a favour and break my nose
or do me a favour and tell me to go away
or do me a favour and stop asking questions
as she walked away, well, her shoes were untied
and the eyes were all red, you could see that we'd cried
and i watched and i waited till she was inside
forcing a smile and waving goodbye
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold
curiosity becomes a heavy load
too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold
do me a favour and ask if you need some help
she said, "do me a favour and stop flattering yourself"
and to tear apart the ties that bind
perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
perhaps "fuck off" might be too kind
open sesame (we've places to go)
we've people to see (let's put 'em on hold)
there's all sorts of shapes that i bet you can make
when you want to escape, say the word
well, i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
with the exception of you, i dislike everyone in the room
and i don't wanna lie, but i don't wanna tell you the truth
get the sense that you're on the move
and you'll probably be leaving soon, so i'm telling you
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
eyes the colour of (water left in mud)
icing sugar dust (crazy green flashes)
it's a funny thing that i cannot explain
don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
well, i know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
and i don't wanna lie, and i don't wanna tell you the truth
and i know we got places to go, we got people to see
think we both oughta put 'em on hold and i know you agree
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
stop the world 'cause i wanna
get off with you
in a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
that it was a heart that he was stealing
oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
the eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
and i bet that juliet was just the icing on the cake
make no mistake, no
and even if somehow we could have
shown you the place you wanted
well, i'm sure you could have
made it that bit better on your own
and i bet she told a million people that she'd stay in touch
but all the little promises, they don't mean much
when there's memories to be made
and i hope you're holding hands by new year's eve
they made it far too easy to believe
that true romance can't be achieved these days
and even if somehow they could have
shown you the place you wanted
well, i'm sure you could have
made it that bit better on your own
you are the only ones who know
brian, top marks for not trying
so kind of you to bless us with your effortlessness
we're grateful and so strangely comforted
and i wonder, are you putting us under?
'cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
well, see you later, innovator
some want to kiss, some want to kick you
there's not a net you couldn't slip through
or at least that's the impression i get
'cause you're smooth and you're wet
and she's not aware yet, but she's yours
she'll be saying, "use me, show me the jacuzzi"
i imagine that it's there on a plate, your whole rendezvous rate
means that you'll never be frightened to make 'em wait for a while
i doubt it's your style not to get what you set out to acquire
the eyes are on fire, you are the unforecasted storm
(brian) calm, collected and commanding
(top marks for not trying) you leave the other story standing
with your renditions and jokes, bet there's hundreds of blokes
that have wept 'cause you've stolen their thunder
are you putting us under?
'cause we can't take our eyes off the t-shirt and ties combination
well, see you later, innovator
do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
or darling, have you started feeling old yet?
don't worry, i'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
with the efficiency that only youth can harness
and do you still think love is a laserquest
or do you take it all more seriously?
i've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that i've had
but you're always busy being make-believe
and do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
when i'm not being honest
i pretend that you were just some lover
now i can't think of there without thinking of you
i doubt that comes as a surprise
and i can't think of anything to dream about
i can't find anywhere to hide
and when i'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
and i convince myself i need another
and for a minute, it gets easier
to pretend that you were just some lover
when i'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
singing dreadful songs about summer
will i have found a better method of
pretending you were just some lover?
will i have found a better method of
pretending you were just some lover?
"shall i keep rolling?"
well, oh, they might wear classic reeboks
or knackered converse, or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
but all of that's what the point is not
the point's that there in't no romance around there
and there's the truth that they can't see
they'd probably like to throw a punch at me
and if you could only see 'em then you would agree
agree that there in't no romance around there
you know? oh, it's a funny thing, you know
we'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen, because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way
'cause over there there's broken bones
there's only music so that there's new ringtones
and it dun't take no sherlock holmes
to see it's a little different around here
don't get me wrong though, there's boys in bands
and kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
and just 'cause he's had a couple of cans
he thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead
don't you know? oh, it's a funny thing, you know
we'll tell 'em if you like, we'll tell 'em all tonight
they'll never listen, because their minds are made up
and course it's all okay to carry on that way
but i said no, oh no
well, you won't get me to go
not anywhere, not anywhere
no, i won't go
oh, no, no
but over there, there's friends of mine
what can i say? i've known 'em for a long long time
and they might overstep the line
but you just cannot get angry in the same way
no, not in the same way
said, not in the same way
oh no, oh no, no
i want an interesting synonym
to describe this thing
that you say we're all grandfathered in
i'll use the search engine
(we've got much to discuss)
too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
i can recall the glow of your low beams
it's the big night in tinsel city
life became a spectator sport
i launch my fragrance called 'integrity'
i sell the fact that i can't be bought
have i told you all about the time that i got sucked into a hole
through a handheld device?
i will flashback now and again, but i'm usually alright
thankfully, the process has been simplified
since the last time you tried
i've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection, opening credits roll
panoramic windows looking out across your soul
you go in through the door
vengeance trilogy wallpaper walls
they have re-decorated it all
they've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side
i've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
vehicles will pass by, but i know when it's you
i'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
i'll be by the batphone if you need to get a hold
making a selection, opening credits roll
killer pink flamingos, computer controlled
panoramic windows looking out across your soul
blind faith, heartache
mind games, mistakes
my sweet fireball
my sweet rigmarole
i want it all
i want it all
old dogs, new tricks
can you feel it?
space age country girl
stone cold miracle
i want it all
i want it all
and then suddenly it hit me, it’s a year ago
since i drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
said, ain’t it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road?
leave me listening to the stones, 2000 light years from home
shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop shoo-wop, shoo-wop
shoo-wop, shoo-wop
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
i want it all
so when you gaze at planet earth from outer space
does it wipe that stupid look off of your face?
i saw this aura over the battleground states
i lost the money, lost the keys
but i'm still handcuffed to the briefcase
and i never thought, not in a million year
that i'd meet so many lolas
can i please have my money back?
my virtual reality mask is stuck on ‘parliament brawl’
emergency battery pack, just in time for my weekly chat
with god on videocall
breaking news, they take the truth and make it fluid
the trainer's explanation was accepted by the steward
a montage of the latest ancient ruins
soundtracked by a chorus of "you don't know what you're doing"
and i never thought, not in a million years
that i'd meet so many lolas
and all of my most muscular regrets
explode behind my eyes like american sports
hoo
and i never thought, not in a million year
that i'd meet so many lolas
old yellow bricks, love's a risk
quite the little escapologist
looked so miffed when you wished
for a thousand places better than this
you are the fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
you can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
she was enraged by the way
that the emperor put traps in the cage
and the days she'd deemed dull
leading to nights reading beer bottles
you're such a fugitive but you don't know what you're running from
you can't kid us and you couldn't trick anyone
houdini, love, you don't know what you're running away from
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
blinded by nostalgia
who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
you're at a loss just because
it wasn't all that you thought it was
you are the fugitive
but you don't know what you're running away from
she said, "i want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
and revel in nostalgia"
i know i said, "who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?"
but dorothy was right though
i etched the face of a stopwatch on the back of a raindrop
and did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
i heard an unhappy ending, it sort of sounds like you leaving
i heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning
you look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
and the literature on how to lose
your waitress was miserable and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
mysteries flashing amber go green when you answer
but the red on the rest of the questionnaire never changes
i heard the news that you're planning
to shoot me out of a cannon
i heard the piledriver waltz, it woke me up this morning
you look like you've been for breakfast at the heartbreak hotel
and sat in the back booth by the pamphlets
and the literature on how to lose
your waitress was miserable and so was your food
if you're gonna try and walk on water
make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
oh-oh, oh-oh
piledriver
one, two, three, four
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like fun)
(she looks like)
smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
i've got the party plugged right into my skull
wayne manor, what a memorable nye
(she looks like fun) good morning
(she looks like fun) cheeseburger
(she looks like fun) snowboarding
(she looks like)
finally, i can share with you through cloudy skies
every whimsical thought that enters my mind
there's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be
(she looks like fun) bukowski
(she looks like fun) dogsitting
(she looks like fun) screwballing
(she looks like)
finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
baby, but why can't we all just get along?
dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are
no one's on the streets
we moved it all online as of march
i'm so full of shite
i need to spend less time stood around in bars
waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
and how much i respect them
(she looks like fun) key changes
(she looks like fun) re-thinking
(she looks like fun) new order
(she looks like fun)
well, last night these two bouncers
and one of 'em's alright, the other one's a scary'un
his way or no way; totalitarian
he's got no time for you looking or breathing
how he don’t want you to, so step out the queue
he makes examples of you, and there's nowt you can say
behind they go through to the bit where you pay
and you realise then that it's finally the time
to walk back past ten-thousand eyes in the line
and you can swap jumpers and make another move
instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
to all the smirking faces and the boys in black
why can't they be pleasant? why can't they have a laugh?
he's got his hand in your chest, he wants to give you a duff
well, secretly i think they want you all to kick off
they want arms flying everywhere and bottles as well
it's just something to talk about, a story to tell, yeah
well, i'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
i said a thousand million things that i could never say this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
well, this town's a different town today
said, this town's a different town to what it was last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
and that girl's a different girl today
said, that girl's a different girl to her you kissed last night
you couldn't have done that on a sunday
of course not
well, i'm so glad they turned us all away, we'll put it down to fate
i thought a thousand million things that i could never think this morning
got too deep, but how deep is too deep?
last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore
i said, last night, what we talked about
it made so much sense
but now the haze has ascended
it don't make no sense anymore, oh
da-da, da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da
da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da
mad sounds, in your ears
make you feel alright
they bring you back to life
mad sounds, in your ears
make you get up and dance
make you get up
yeah, they make you get up
love buckles under the strain
of those wild nights
run but you cannot hide
mad sounds, in your ears
make you get up and dance
make you get up
all night long they reappear
make you get up and dance
yeah, they make you get up
suppose you've gotta do what you've gotta do
we just weren't feeling how we wanted to
you sit and try sometimes
but you just can’t figure out what went wrong
then out of nowhere, somebody comes and hits you with an
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
you got those mad sounds, in your ears
to make you get up and dance
mad sounds, in your ears
they make you get up and dance
hold on to make you get up
ah yeah, they make you get up
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh la la la, ooh
last night when my psyche's
subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
you slowly dropped your eyelids
when true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice
and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit, sometimes i fantasise about you too
the leader of the free world
reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
he's got him sen a theme tune
they play it for him as he makes his way to the ring
and in response to what you whispered in my ear
i must admit, sometimes i fantasise about you too
in the daytime
bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
summat else to publicise
i'm sure you've heard about enough
so in response to what you whispered in my ear
i'll be upfront, sometimes i fantasise about you too
anticipation has the habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment, but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
the lairy girls hung out the window of the limousine
of course it's fancy dress
and they're all looking quite full on
in bunny ears and devil horns and how
anticipation has the habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment, but
tonight there'll be some love
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
regardless of what's gone before
i want to see all of the things that we've already seen
i wanna see you take the jackpot out the fruit machine
and put it all back in
you've got to understand that
you can never beat the bandit, no
and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that it says is that you've drank a lot
and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind
yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind
and you can pour your heart out but her reasoning will block
owt you send her after nine o' clock
anticipation has the habit to set you up
for disappointment in evening entertainment, but
tonight there'll be some love, oh
tonight there'll be a ruckus, yeah
regardless of what's gone before
and she won't be surprised and she won't be shocked
when she's pressed the star after she's pressed unlock
and there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
and all that it says is that you've drank a lot
and you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind
yeah, you should bear that in mind tonight
bear that in mind
and you can pour your heart out around three o' clock
when the two-for-one's undone the writer's block
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the room
more point to a wedding disco
without a bride or groom
and there's a super cool band, yeah
with their trilbies and their glasses of white wine
and all the weekend rockstars are in the toilets
practicing their lines
i don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, i don't want to hear your
fake tales of san francisco
echo through the air
and there's a few bored faces at the back, all
wishing they weren't there
and as the microphone squeaks
a young girl's telephone beeps
yeah, she's dashing for the exit
oh, she's running to the streets outside
"oh, you've saved me," she screams down the line
"the band were fucking wank and i'm not having a nice time"
i don't want to hear you (kick me out, kick me out)
i don't want to hear you, no (kick me out, kick me out)
yeah, but his bird said it's amazing though, so all that's left
is the proof that love's not only blind, but deaf
he talks of san francisco, he's from hunter's bar
i don't quite know the distance, but i'm sure that's far
yeah, i'm sure it's pretty far
and yeah, i'd love to tell you all my problem
you're not from new york city, you're from rotherham
so get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook
get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook, yeah
you push the button and we'll do the rest
the exotic sound of data storage
nothing like it, first thing in the morning
you push the button and we'll do the rest
bastard latin, that's the best thing for it
you push the button and we'll do the rest
you and lizzy in the summertime
wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby
there are things that i just cannot explain to you
and those that i hope i don't ever have to
pattern language, in the mood for love
you push the button and we'll do the rest
you and genie wearing stetson hats
trying to gain access to my lily pad
there are things that i just cannot explain to you
and those that i hope i don't ever have to
the world's first ever monster truck front flip
i'm just a bad girl trying to be good
i've got a laser guiding my love that i cannot adjust
forward-thinking model villages
more brain shrinking moving images
you push the button and we'll do the rest
religious iconography giving you the creeps?
i feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
the rise of the machines
i must admit you gave me something momentarily
in which i could believe
but the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
and it's on its way back here to scoop you up
but not on my watch
i want to stay with you, my love
the way some science fiction does
reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
the ascension of the c.r.e.a.m
mass panic on a not too distant future colony
quantitative easing
i want to make a simple point about peace and love
but in a sexy way where it's not obvious
highlight dangers and send out hidden messages
the way some science fiction does
the way some science fiction does
got the world on a wire
in my little mirror, mirror on the wall
in the pocket of my raincoat
so i tried to write a song to make you blush
but i've a feeling that the whole thing
may well just end up too clever for its own good
the way some science fiction does
running off over next door's garden before the hour is done
it's more a question of feeling than it is a question of fun
the confidence is the balaclava, i'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
will the ending reek of salty cheeks and runny makeup alone?
or will blood run down the face of a boy bewildered and scorned
and you'll find yourself in a skirmish where you wish you'd never been born?
you tie yourself to the tracks and there isn't no going back
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but we'll do it anyway 'cause we love a bit of trouble
are you pulling her from a burning building or throwing her to the sharks?
can only hope that the ending is as pleasurable as the start
the confidence is the balaclava, i'm sure you'll baffle 'em straight
and it's wrong, wrong, wrong, but she can hardly wait
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
now the shaggers perform and the daggers are drawn
who's the crooks in this crime?
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
that's right, he won't let her out his sight
well, you'll be able to boast
of the day of the most flawless heist of all time
you knew that it'd be trouble right before the very first kiss
quiet and unassuming but you heard that they were the naughtiest
she pleaded with you to take it off but you resisted and fought
but sorry, sweetheart, i'd much rather keep on the balaclava
if you can summon the strength, tow me
i can't hold down the urgency
you've got to make your descent slowly
and oil up those sticky keys
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller
it's a necessary evil
no cause for emergency
borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
oh, momentary synergy
coax me out my low
sink into tomorrow
coax me out my low
and have a spin of my propeller
my propeller won't spin
and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
oh, my propeller won't spin
and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
oh, my propeller won't spin
and i can't get it started on my own
when are you arriving?
oh, my propeller
trudging through the morning
the tramp with the trampoline under his arm
shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
but the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
and the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
in your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
unwilling to wind uncooperative time
so he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the
what came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
and twilight forced you to go on a walk
your legs start running and your head gets caught
canopy 19 is perfectly placed
for the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
you'll have to slip away, i am unhappy to say
behold as the crook in the hammock plays
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
behold as a crook in the hammock plays
cruelly with the base and the scales
and fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp
cruelly with the base and the scales
and fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
she was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
trailing wrapped in a gasp
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
all the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
and cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
lady, where has your love gone?
i was looking but can't find it anywhere
they always offer when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some, it's nowhere to be found
well, i know your game, you told him yesterday
"no chance, you'll get nothing from me"
but now she's there, you're there and everybody's there
he's in turmoil, as puzzled as can be, just like me
let's go down, down, low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she, you think she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?
lady, where has your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
to hold you by the hand
must you first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more
just once more
let's go down, down, low down
where i know i should not go
oh, and she, you think she's the one
but she's just one in twenty-four
and just 'cause everybody's doing it
does that mean that i can too?
oh, her eyes went down and cut you up
and there's nothing like a dirty look from
the one you want or the one you've lost
an ache in your soul, it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
that's why you're after her and that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
and they'll realise that it won't change a thing
realise that it won't change a thing
she's thunderstorms
lying on her front, up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
i've been feeling foolish, you should try it
she came and substituted the peace and quiet for
acrobatic blood flow concertina
cheating heart beat, rapid fire
she's thunderstorms
lying on her front, up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
here is your host, sounds as if she's pretty close
when the heat starts growing horns
she's thunderstorms
she's been loop-the-looping around my mind
her motorcycle boots give me this kind of
acrobatic blood concertina
cheating heart beat, rapid fire
she's thunderstorms
lying on her front, up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
in an unusual place, when you're feeling far away
she does what the night does to the day
she's thunderstorms
lying on her front, up against the wall
she's thunderstorms
thunderstorms
thunderstorms
fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
that you would rather be beside than in front of
but she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
she swam out of tonight's phantasm
grabbed my hand and made it very clear
there's absolutely nothing for us here
it's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a wednesday night
it's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
at least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture
and the secret door swings behind us
she's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
her arms were folded most indignant
not looking like she was soon to leave
i had to squint in order to believe
then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
i'm unveiling the unexpected
i, who was earlier reluctant
was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
how could such a creature survive in such a habitat?
and the secret door swings behind us
she's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
even if they were to find us
i wouldn't notice, i'm completely occupied
as all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
ones you would rather be beside than in front of
but she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
but you're daft to think she'd care
fools on parade
fools on parade
fools on parade
conduct a sing-along
you got your h.p. lovecraft
your edgar allan poe
you got your unkind of ravens
and your murder of crows
catty eyelashes
and your dracula cape
been flashing triple-a passes
at the cemetery gates
'cause you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard
you're so dark, baby
you're so dark
you're so dark
you're so dark
you're so dark
and you're so mysterious
got that obsession with death
i saw you driving your prius
and even that was munster koach-esque
you watch italian horror
and you listen to the scores
leather-cladded, spike collared
i want you down on all fours
'cause you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard
you're so dark, baby
i know you're nothing like mine
'cause she's walking on sunshine
and your love would tear us apart
and i know i'm not your type
'cause i don't shun the daylight
but, baby, i'm willing to start
you're so dark
got your h.p. lovecraft
your edgar allen poe
got your unkind of ravens
got your murder of crows
you're so dark, babe
but i want you hard
you're so dark, baby
but i want you hard
you're so dark, oh
but i want you hard
you're so dark, baby
he knew what he wanted to say
but he didn't know how to word it
the dirty little herbert was seeking an escape
but the place was well-guarded
the guiltiness that started
soon as the other part had stopped
'd' is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
i think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
'd' is for desperately trying to simulate
what it was that was alright
three quarters of an hour ago
that had led him to be in a position
on the brink of a mission
on the brink of an episode
he's nearing the brink but he thinks first
a parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
he's nearing the brink but he thinks first
a parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
he's nearing the brink but he thinks first
a parallel universe perhaps could be the perfect scene
he's nearing the brink but he thinks first
a parallel—i think you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
'd' is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
you should know you're his favourite worst nightmare
lately, i've been seeing things
belly button piercings
in the sky at night
when we're side by side
and i don't mean to rain
on anybody's cabriolet
one of those games you're gonna lose
but you wanna play it, just in case
now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide
does it help you stay up late?
does it help you concentrate?
does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
am i ruining your fun?
and you talk the talk alright
but do you walk the walk or catch the train?
you wanted it, you got it
but you don't want it now
now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
more like black treacle than tar
black treacle
somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
and so they found a place to hide
now i'm out of place and i'm not getting any wiser
i feel like the sundance kid behind a synthesizer
and i tried last night to pack away your laugh
like a key under the mat
but it never seems to be there when you want it
black treacle
black treacle
black treacle
he's pining for her in a people carrier
there might be buildings and pretty things to see like that but architecture won't do
although it might say a lot about the city or town
i don't care what they've got, keep on turning 'em down
it don't say the funny things she does
don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen
he's got the feeling again, this time on the aeroplane
there might be tellies in the back of the seats in front, but rodney and del won't do
although it might take your mind off the aches and the pains
laugh when he falls through the bar but you're feeling the same
'cause she isn't there to hold your hand
she won't be waiting for you when you land
and it feels like she's just nowhere near
you could well be out on your ear
this thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill
yesterday, i saw a girl who looked like someone you might knock about with
and almost shouted
and then reality kicked in within us, it seems as we become the winners
you lose a bit of summat, and half wonder if you won it at all
and don't say owt 'cause you've got no idea
and she's still nowhere near
and the thought comes closely followed by the fear
and the thought of it makes you feel a bit ill
despair in the departure lounge
it's one and they'll still be around at three
no signal and low battery
what's happened to me?
fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
dull caresses once again irritate
tread softly, stranger
move over toward the danger that you seek
you think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
the logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
handsome and faceless
and weightless, your imagination runs
and now it's no one's fault but yours
at the foot of the house of cards
you thought you'd never get obsessed
you thought the wolves would be impressed
and you're a sinking stone
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
that procession of pioneers all drowned
in the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
as he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
watching his exit
was like falling off the ferry in the night
the inevitables gather to push you around
any other voice makes such a punishing sound
he became laughter's assassin
shortly after he showed you what it was
and now it's no one's fault but yours
at the foot of the house of cards
you thought you'd never get obsessed
you thought the wolves would be impressed
and you're a sinking stone
but you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
that procession of pioneers all drowned
if you've a lesson to teach me
i'm listening, ready to learn
there's no one here to police me
i'm sinking in until the return
if you've a lesson to teach
please don't deviate, don't be afraid
without the last corner piece, i can't calibrate
let's get it ingrained
if you've a lesson to teach me
i'm listening, ready to learn
there's no one here to police me
i'm sinking in until the return
if you've a lesson to teach
please don't deviate, don't be afraid
without the last corner piece, i can't calibrate
let's get it ingrained
if you've a lesson to teach me
i'm listening, ready to learn
there's no one here to police me
i'm sinking in until the return
if you've a lesson to teach
please don't deviate, don't be afraid
without the last corner piece, i can't calibrate
let's get it ingrained
topless models doing semaphore
wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
illuminations on a rainy day
when she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade
i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
called up to listen to the voice of reason
and got the answering machine
the type of kisses where teeth collide
when she laughs, the heavens hum a stun gun lullaby
those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by
i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is i need
called up to listen to the voice of reason
and got his answering machine
i left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
and now i'm stuck still wondering how it's meant to be
singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
reckless serenade, reckless serenade
reckless serenade, reckless serenade
reckless serenade
i heard the truth was built to bend
a mechanism to suspend
the guilt is what you will require
and still you've got to dance little liar
just like those fibs to pop and fizz
and you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
and you're bound to trip
and she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up
and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when there's dirt beneath the dirt
the liar takes a lot less time
i'm sure it's clear and plain to read
it's not an alibi you need just yet
oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
yes, that will get you back to normal
and after you have dabbed the patch
you'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
the varnish off that newly added calmness
so as not to raise any alarms too soon
and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when there's dirt beneath the dirt
the liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
have you got itchy bones? and in all your time alone
can you hack your mind being riddled
with the wrong memories?
and the clean coming will hurt
and you can never get it spotless
when there's dirt between the dirt
one look sends it coursing through the veins
oh, how the feeling races
back up to their brains
to form expressions on their stupid faces
they don't want to say hello
like i want to say hello
well, the heartbeat's at its peak
when you're coming up to speak
and oh, i'm so tense, never tenser
could all go a bit frank spencer
and i'm talking gibberish
tip of the tongue but i can't deliver it
properly, oh, it's all getting on top of me
and if it weren't this dark
you'd see how red my face has gone, yeah
everybody's trying to crack the jokes and that
to make you smile
those that claim that they're not showing off
are drowning in denial
but they're not half as bad as me
say anything and i'll agree
'cause when it comes to acting up
i'm sure i could write the book
and now that you're more than a part in the play
it's slightly easier to think what to say
you had us all standing on our heads
doing our best tricks, yeah
never again
well, never again, no
will there be another one quite as desirable as you
one look sends it coursing through the veins
oh, how the feeling races
back up to their brains
to form expressions on their stupid faces
so up rolls a riot van
and sparks excitement in the boys
but the policemen look annoyed
perhaps these are ones they should avoid
got a chase last night
from men with truncheons dressed in hats
we didn't do that much wrong
still ran away though, for the laugh
just for the laugh
and please just stop talking
'cause they won't find us if you do
oh, those silly boys in blue
well, they won't catch me and you
"have you been drinking, son?
you don't look old enough to me"
"i'm sorry, officer
is there a certain age you're supposed to be?
'cause nobody told me"
and up rolls the riot van
and these lads just wind the coppers up
they ask why they don't catch proper crooks
they get their address and their names took
but they couldn't care less
thrown in the riot van
and all the coppers kicked him in
and there was no way he could win
just had to take it on the chin
break a mirror, roll the dice
run with scissors through a chip pan fire fight
go into business with a grizzly bear
but just don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair
find a well-known hard man and start a fight
wear your shell suit on bonfire night
fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
but just don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair
oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
bite the lightning and tell me how it tastes
kung fu fighting on your roller skates
do the macarena in the devil's lair
but just don't sit down 'cause i've moved your chair
oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
oooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
oooh
we'll ask if we can have six in
if not we'll have to have two
well, you're coming up at our end aren't you?
so i'll get one with you
won't he let us have six in?
especially not with the food
he could have just told us no, though
he didn't have to be rude
you see her with the green dress?
she talked to me at the bar
well, how come it's already two-pound fifty?
we've only gone about a yard
didn't you see she were gorgeous?
she were beyond belief
but this lad at the side drinking his smirnoff ice
came and paid for her tropical reef
and i'm sitting, going backwards
and i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please!"
well, how funny were that sketch earlier
up near that taxi rank?
oh no, you would have missed it
think it were when you went to the bank
these two lads squaring up, proper shouting
'bout who were next in the queue
the kind of thing that'd seem so silly
but not when they've both had a few
well, calm down, temper, temper
you shouldn't get so annoyed
well, you're acting like a silly little boy
oh, they wanted to be men
and do some fighting in the street
he said, "no surrender
no chance of retreat"
and so why are they in the taxi?
'cause i didn't want to leave
i said, "it's high green, mate
via hillsborough, please!"
drunken plots hatched to jump it
ask around, "are you sure?"
went for it, but the red light was showing
and red light indicates doors are secure
just when things are getting complicated
in the eye of the storm
she flicks a red-hot revelation
off the tip of her tongue
it does a dozen somersaults
and leaves you supercharged
makes me wanna blow the candles out
just to see if you glow in the dark
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
home sweet home, home sweet home
home sweet booby-trap
i took the batteries out my mysticism
and put 'em in my thinking cap
she's got a telescopic hallelujah
hanging up on her wall
for when it gets too complicated
in the eye of the storm
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
oh, oh-oh-oh
and in a hellcat spangled cavern
when your judgement's on the run
and you're acting like a stranger
'cause you thought it looked like fun
and did you ever get the feeling
that these are things she's said before?
her steady hands may well have done the devil's pedicure
what you waiting for?
sing another fucking shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
shalalala
this house is a circus, berserk as fuck
we tend to see that as a perk, though
look what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
this house is a circus, berserk as fuck
we tend to see that as a perk, though
look what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
there's a room full of trouble and there's lovers to be had
those ones who make sinners out of such lovely lads
scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
and the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
and we're forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes
forever unfulfilled and can't think why
like a search for murder clues in dead men's eyes
the more you open your mouth, the more you're forcing performance
and all the attention is leading me to feel important
(give me obnoxious, give me obnoxious now)
now that we're here, we may as well go too far
wriggling around in incidents you won't forget
there's certainly some venom in the looks that you collect
aimlessly gazing at the faces in the kiln
and we're struggling with the notion that it's life, not film
this house is a circus, berserk as fuck (we're forever unfulfilled)
we tend to see that as a perk, though (can't think why)
look what it's done to your friends
their memories are pretend (like a search for murder clues)
and the last thing that they want is for the feeling to end
you showed me my tomorrow beside a box of matches
a welcome threatening stir
my hopes of being stolen might just ring true
depends who you prefer
if it's true you're gonna run away
tell me where, i'll meet you there
am i snapping the excitement
if i pack away the laughter and tell you how it feels?
and does burden come to meet ya
if i've questions of the feature that rolls on your dream reel?
the day after you stole my heart
everything i touched told me
it would be better shared with you, with you
and now you're hiding in my soup
and this book reveals your face
and you're splashing in my eyelids
as the concentration continually breaks
i did request the mark you cast
didn't heal as fast
i hear your voice in silences
will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?
in the jostling crowd, you're not allowed to tell the truth
and the photo booth's a liar
and there's a sharpened explanation
but there's no screaming reason to inquire
i'd like to poke them in their prying eyes with things
they'd never see if it smacked them in their temples
get on your dancing shoes
there's one thing on your mind
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through
oh and the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting and
the only reason that you came
so what you scared for?
well, don't you always do the same?
it's what you're there for, don't you know?
the lights are flashing
down in here tonight
and some might exchange a glance
but keep pretending to dance
don't act like it's not happening
as if it's impolite
to go and mention your name
instead you'll just do the same as they all do
and hope for the best
the only reason that you came
so what you scared for?
well, don't you always do the same?
it's what you’re there for, but no
get on your dancing shoes
you sexy little swine
hoping they're looking for you
sure you'll be rummaging through
i said, the shit, shock, horror
you've seen your future bride, yeah
yeah, but it's oh so absurd
for you to say the first word
so you're waiting and waiting
there's always somebody taller with more of a wit
and he's equipped to enthrall her and her friends think he’s fit
and you just can't measure up though, you don't have a prayer
wishing that you'd made the most of her when she was there
they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
he's pinched your bird and he'd probably kick your head in
bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you’re better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but i know you were though
now you don't know what she's up to, you can only assume
if she's not in the front of the shops then they've gone to his room
bet she's gone 'round in her school stuff, bet that’s what he likes
i know you thought she were different and you thought she were nice
but she's not nice, she's pretty fucking far from nice
she’s looking at you funny, rarely looking at you twice
bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, you’re better off without her anyway
you said you wasn't sad to see her go
yeah, but it's clear you were though
have you heard what she has been doing? never did it for me
he picks her up at the school gate at twenty past three
she’s been with all of the boys but never went very far
and she wagged english and science just to go in his car
they've got engaged, there's no intention of a wedding
he's pinched me bird and he'd probably kick my head in
oh, now the girls have grown
yeah, but i'm sure that they still carry on in similar ways
bigger boys and stolen sweethearts
oh, i'm better off without her anyway
i said i wasn’t sad to see her go
yeah, but i’m only pretending, you know
yeah, i’m only pretending, you know
i was only pretending, you know
i was only pretending, you know
do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse
oh, the night's like a whirlwind
somebody's girlfriend's talking to me, but it's alright
she's saying that he's not gonna slap me or try to attack me
he's not the jealous type
and i only need to get half an excuse and i'm away
but when there's no excuses, that's much easier to say
i've been before
and all these capers make us to look for it to ignore
see, she's talking but i'm not entirely sure
do the bad thing
take off your wedding ring
but it won't make it that much easier
it might make it worse
oh, a sudden disheartener
somebody's partner's talking to me
but i don't know that is what she isn't
she murmurs things to confirm that the tragedy is true
and i knew, how could she not? she could have anyone she wants
and i'm struggling to think of an immediate response
like, "i don't mind, it'd be a big mistake for you to wait
and let me waste your time
really, love, it's fine"
i said, "really, love, it's fine"
and then the first time it occurred that there was something to destroy
i knew before the invitation that there was this ploy
oh, but she carried on suggesting, a struggle to refuse
she said, "it's the red wine this time," but that is no excuse
if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
three-hundred and fifty "no, thank you"s and nobody flinches
go on, girl, go on, give us something gruesome
we require your grief, the thugs help the thieves
as they're trying to rob the words from her gob and
take the source of the innocence
if you were there, beware the serpent soul pinchers
can't you sense she was never meant to fill column inches
ain't you had enough? what you're trying to dig up
isn't there to be dug; the thieves help the thugs
as they're trying to beat the good grace of a sweetheart
out to the point she'll comply
and why leave her on her own?
if i'd have known then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known
why leave her on her own?
if i predicted tears then i wouldn't have said it
i wouldn't have said it if i would have known
there's a circle of witches, ambitiously vicious they are
our attempts to remind them of reason won't get us that far
but i don't know what it is that they want
i don't know what it is that they want
but i haven't got it to give
and she hasn't got it to give
a pussyfooting setting sun
make a wish that weighs a tonne
there are no handles for you to hold
and no understanding where it goes
jealousy in technicolor
fear by name, love by numbers
street lamp amber, wanderlust
powder in a blunderbuss
she looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one
that time has got it in for, honey
that's where you're wrong
all the old flames fastened on
make a wish that weighs a tonne
there are no handles you can hold
and no understanding where it goes
she looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
and suddenly the sky is a scissor
sitting on the floor with a tambourine
crushing up a bundle of love
don't take it so personally
you're not the only one
that time has got it in for, honey
that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong
that's where you're wrong
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
just another microcosm somewhere in the ether
putting the world to rights with bing crosby eyes
oversharing and its bitter aftertaste
exactly the wrong time in exactly the wrong place
save it for a rainy day
baby, you go hard in the paint
it's just another race to anyways
philanthropic toga party
what a place for both the opposite sides of my double life to finally collide
sharing secrets i was taking to the grave
nosebleeds from epiphanies i took full in the face
oh, come all by the fire, babe, let’s all participate
in yet another race to anyways
oh, how's your mum and dad been doing with the generation gap?
yeah, i'm behind my movie camera
i’ve got my megaphone
you can call me alexander
it's nice to meet you all
listening to the shipping forecast
driving to the airport
me and the guys
metropolis ablaze in the rear view
devising methods to both have and eat your cake
mmm, just like the ones that mother nature used to bake
you look as if you know exactly what i'm gonna say
it's just another race to
anyways
i've seen your eyes as they fix on me
what is he doing? what on earth's the plan, has he got one?
you better give me some pointers
since you are the big rocket launcher and i'm just the shotgun
i ain't got no dollar signs in my eyes
that might be a surprise but it's true, said, i'm not like you
and i don't want your advice or your praise
or to move in the ways you do and i never will
'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail
i've seen your eyes as they fix on me, full of confusion
your snarl is just so condescending!
trying to explain that we're on to a win
if the fee we get in near recoups what we're spending
he said, "i can't believe that you drove all that way
well how much did they pay ya? how much did they pay ya?
you'd have been better to stay round our way"
thinking about things but not actually doing the things
'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail
'cause all you people are vampires
and all your stories are stale
and though you pretend to stand by us
i know you're certain we'll fail
all you people are vampires!
we all want someone to shout for
yeah, everyone wants somebody to adore
but your heroes aren't what they seem
when you've been where we've been
have i done something to trigger
the funny looks and the sniggers?
are they there at all
or is it just paranoia?
'cause everybody's got their box
doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns
don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us
and there's a couple of hundred
think they're christopher columbus
but the settlers had already settled
here long before you
just 'cause we're having a say-so
not lining up to be play-doh
oh, in five years' time will it be
"who the fuck's arctic monkeys?"
'cause everybody's got their box
doing what they're told
you push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns
don't care if it's marketing suicide
we won't crack or compromise
your derisory divides
will never unhinge us
all the thoughts that i just said
linger 'round and multiply in the head
not that bad to start with
i'm not angry, i'm just disappointed
it's not you, it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues
it's not you, it's them that are wrong
tell 'em to take out their tongues
tell 'em to take out their tongues
and bring on the backlash
it's not you, it's them that are wrong
tell him to take out his tongue
tell him to take out his tongue
it's not you, it's them that's the fake
i won't mess with your escape
is this really your escape? yeah
i'm pinned down by the dark
been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
yes, i'm battling that well-told gripe, the most frustrating type
you should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
and you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me
i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the light it fidgets through, the thoughts'll soon revert to you
about as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance
and course the audience of frighteners and fiends
divided up into two teams
when the acrobat fell off the beam, she broke everyone's heart
i'm pinned down by the dark
a-n-i-m-a-l
makes my head pirouette
more than i would be willing to confess
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
the most unsuitable pet
it's been long enough now so let's
make a mess, lioness
i'm pinned down by the dark
i'm pinned down by the dark, oh-oh-oh
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
d-a-n-g-e-r-o-u-s
a-n-i-m-a-l
the smiles as she walked in the room
have all turned into frowns
am i too quick to assume that the love is no longer in bloom?
the tantrums and the tears play a very different tune
to what they did before, her head's red raw
and the ending doesn't sound like the happiest around
when you sobbed before
it felt much more like the product of a squabble
now there's reason for it to be something more
and there would be, oh, it's uncertain
whether the curtain has shut for good
she said, "see if it's still raining, i'm not dressed for it"
and, "if you loved me–"
and i interrupted, received a scowl and stare
but still decided to stop her there
would it be outrageous to say
we're either shouting or we're shagging?
docked in tempestuous bays
or at least that's how it felt yesterday
the eyes are getting heavier
and whether you're asleep or awake
is a mystery
would a kiss be too much to ask?
when you fit me
as sunday's frozen pitch fits the thermos flask
it's a pity
it just hit me, we can't go back
to the chest touching on the back
i'm in a vest
library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of its kind to get to the moon
trust some ellipses to chase you 'round the room
through curly straws and metaphors and goo
been watching all the neon blossom flickering
you look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
library pictures of the quickening canoe
the first of its kind to get to the moon
give me an eeny, meeny, miny, moe
or an ip, dip, dog shit rock and roll
well, this is a good idea
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't
he wouldn't do it if it wasn't one
well, my friend fancies you
oh, what a way to begin it all
you said, "they're always exciting words to hear"
and they woke up together not quite realising how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning
and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now
they left before the lights came on
because they didn't want to ruin what it was that was brewing
before they absolutely had to
and how can you wake up with someone you don't love
and not feel slightly fazed by it?
oh, he had a struggle
and they woke up together not quite realising how
awkwardly stretching and yawning
it's always hard in the morning
and i suppose that's the price you pay
well, oh, it isn't what it was
she's thinking he looks different today
and now there's nothing left to guess now
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
well, quick, let's leave before the lights come on
'cause then you don't have to see
'cause then you don't have to see what you've done
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up, what time's the bus come?
i'll walk you up
well, it's ever so funny
'cause i don't think you're special, i don't think you're cool
you're just probably alright
but under these lights you look beautiful
and i'm struggling
i can't see through your fake tan
yeah, and you know it for a fact
that everybody's eating out of your hands
but what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
said, you don't know nothing
well, fancy seeing you in here
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
well, i haven't seen you since last year
yeah, and surprisingly you have forgotten my name
but you know it
yeah, and you knew it all along
oh, and you say you have forgotten
but you're fibbing, go on, tell me i'm wrong
so what do you know?
oh, you know nothing
yeah, but i'll still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
so what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing, no
oh-woah, woah, woah
oh-woah, woah, woah
da-da, da-da-da, da-da, da-da
da-da, da-da, da-da-da
oh-woah, woah, woah
oh, so what do you know?
yeah, you don't know nothing, no
yeah, but i'd still take you home
oh, yeah, i'll still take you home
i said, what do you know?
oh, you don't know nothing
i fancy you with a passion
oh, you're a topshop princess, a rockstar too
but you're a fad and you're a fashion
and i'm having a job trying to talk to you
but it's alright
yeah, i'll put it on one side
oh, 'cause everybody's looking
you've got control of everyone's eyes, including mine
i wish you would have smiled in the bakery
or sat on a tatty settee
at a mutual friend's gathering
and the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
love, we're in stalemate
to never meet is surely where we're bound
there's one in every town
just there to grind you down
i wish i would have seen you in the post office
well, maybe i did and i missed it
too busy with the mind on clever lines
why not the rounders pitch or the canteen?
you're slacking, love, where have you been?
just had to go and wait until tonight
to give me the invite
don't worry, it's alright
i wish i would have seen you down in the arcade
sipping on a lemonade
in the paper cup and chewing on the straw
and i wish i'd seen you in the bakery
but if i'd seen you in the bakery
you probably wouldn't have seen me
i was biting the time zone
and we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
and threw caution to the colourful
then we fell asleep in the car
until the bumps woke me up in your grip
and the tide took me to your mouth
and then swept me back down to your palms
it's them that put me inside the reminder
that yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna hang on
i've got this ego mechanic
she's always trying to give me vitamins
ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
i preferred her as a cartoon
if i could be someone else for a week
i'd spend it chasing after you
'cause she's not shattering my attitudes
no matter how she folds the potion
yours is the only ocean
yours is the only ocean
that i wanna swing from
yours is the only ocean
that i want to hang on to
potion approaching, shield your eyes
potion approaching, visualise
holding a token, swollen in size
potion approaching, shield your eyes
oh, but if we're gonna escape though
we really ought to think it through
would you like me to build you a go-kart?
take a little walk to the edge of town and go across the tracks
where the viaduct looms like a bird of doom as it shifts and cracks
where secrets lie in the border fires and the humming wires
well, you know you're never coming back
past the square, past the bridge, past the mills, past the stacks
on a gathering storm comes a tall handsome man
in a dusty black coat with a red right hand
he'll wrap you in his arms and tell ya that you've been a good boy
he'll rekindle all of those dreams it took you a lifetime to destroy
he'll reach deep into the hole, heal your shrinking soul
and there won't be a single thing that you can do
he's a god, he's a man, he's a ghost, he's a guru
they're whispering his name 'cross this disappearing land
but hidden in his coat is a red right hand
you don't have no money? he'll get you some
if you haven't got no car, he'll get you one
you've got no self-respect, you feel like an insect
well, don't you worry, buddy, 'cause here he comes
through the ghetto and the barrows
and the bowery and the slums
a shadow is cast wherever he stands
stacks of green paper in his red right hand
you'll see him in your nightmares, you'll see him in your dreams
he'll appear out of nowhere, but he's not what he seems
you'll see him in your head and on the tv screen
hey, buddy, i'm warning you to turn it off
he's a ghost, he's a god, he's a man, he's a guru
you're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan
designed and directed by his red right hand
caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
in my mind all the time
i wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
where you go for a smoke
and sorrow slow dances
the phones are lighting up
taking no chances
close but never close enough
been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves
all my own stunts, high noon has changed its tune
linking arms, sinking hearts
and sorrow slow dances
around the edges of her eyes
taking no chances
the last one out to win a prize
been watching cowboy films
on gloomy afternoons
tinting the solitude
put on your dancing shoes
and show me what to do
i know you've got the moves
i'm from high green
i'm from high green
baby, i'm yours (baby, i'm yours)
and i'll be yours until the stars fall from the sky
yours until the rivers all run dry
in other words, until i die
baby, i'm yours (baby, i'm yours)
and i'll be yours until the sun no longer shines
yours until the poets run out of rhyme
in other words, until the end of time
i'm gonna stay right here by your side
and do my best to keep you satisfied
nothing in the world could drive me away
every day, you'll hear me say
baby, i'm yours (baby, i'm yours)
and i'll be yours until two and two is three
yours until the mountain crumbles to the sea
in other words, until eternity
baby, i'm yours, 'til the stars fall from the sky
baby, i'm yours, until the rivers all run dry
baby, i'm yours, until the sun no longer shines
baby, i'm yours, until the poets run out of rhyme
baby, i'm yours
i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the first thing that she said
temptation greets you like your naughty mate
the one that used to get you in bother
but one you could never bring yourself to hate
and she said we've got that spark
but only lights a fuse, helps you see in the dark
but it's a sight you'll lose when
the temptation greets you like your naughty friend
i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead
temptation greets you like your naughty mate
the one that made you steal and set things on fire
the one you haven't seen of late
and i said that kind of talk
only adds intrigue to the cauldron of thought
it's already exceeding
temptation, the very thing that held her back
i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead
i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it
and your hands where i can
yo, it's rasc' gettin' dirtee stankin', yeah
we used to be in tight, me and my naughty friends
caused pure madness in the end, i mean day and night
we robbed, we stole, we loved to fight
smoking, drinking, drag riding
drugs, thugs, not law-abiding
reckless youngsters, no direction, no sign of correction
but then i switched it off, changed my ways
run the area like, "oh, my days"
but a lot of my naughty friends, they're not phased
can't believe that this music pays
see no reason why we can't do
all the things that we've always done
still in my heart i know that's just one
but it's hard to fight the temptation, son
the panic will fall down around you
if you don't do what i say
i don't ever want to hate you
so don't show me your bed
the only roads are cul-de-sacs
the only ends are dead
i don't ever want to hate you
it's not part of the plan
so keep your charm where i can't see it
and your hands where i can
both sides
in softly came the growl from both sides
and if his whisper splits the mist
just think of what he's capable of with his kiss
nice try
you cannot turn away, but nice try
turned your legs to little building blocks
and with his index finger, flicks you on your socks
i go high-pitched
he'll talk and make your voice sound high-pitched
dread to think if he got you on your own
and whispered in your ear in that baritone
it's the same stone
his heart was cut out of the same stone
that they used to carve his jaw
it's impossible not to feel inferior
and he could catapult you back to your daddy
or into any hissing misery
and he will tell you how the day after a triumph
is as hollow as the day after a tragedy
he'll extinguish any chance of escape
when he slaps you on your arse or kisses your nape
and he's leaving without saying bye
and you will queue up to listen to him pissing
and hang around to watch some poor girl blub
and then they chase him down the avenue
incessantly pestering him to let him join the club
he knows how to put a cork in the fuss
and just how to shut up the charming ones of us
and i've seen him talking to your lady friend
there's a dust track waiting for betrayal
where he'll teach you all the bits they missed
nice try
you cannot turn away, but nice try
nice try
you cannot turn away, but nice try
nice try
you cannot turn away, but nice try
nice try
you cannot turn away, but nice try
you cannot turn away
i wanna build you up
brick by brick
i wanna break you down
brick by brick
i’m gonna reconstruct
brick by brick
i wanna feel your love
brick by brick, aaaaah
brick by brick, aaaaah
i wanna steal your soul
brick by brick
i wanna rock and roll
brick by brick
i wanna rock and roll
brick by brick
i wanna rock and roll
brick by brick, aaaaah
brick by brick, aaaaah
i wanna brick by brick
brick by brick
i wanna blow by blow
brick by brick
i want an empty soul
brick by brick
i wanna brick by brick by brick by...
brick by brick, aaaaah
brick by brick, aaaaah
well, the times are slowly changing
baby, even when it's live
you can press pause and rewind
you knew it'd go amazing
but is this what you had in mind?
oh, there's nothing you can't find
it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thirteen
(yeah)
on the back of a transmitter
there's a little shiny fruit
and it's coming after you
as for instagram and twitter
she got caught in both lassoes
and neither one will cut her loose
it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thir–
–teen
(yeah)
yeah
so, baby, take a walk with me
past flying cars and time machines
there's magic like you won't believe, no
it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
it's two thousand and thirteen
all across the galaxy
darlin’, tell me something i don’t know
be my baby, be my gto
call me something no one else calls me
i forget how i want it, that electricity
well, my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn’t see you sneak in, but i’m glad you stopped
tell me something i don’t already know
like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
love like locked horns, love like dominos
be my midnight, be my ebb and flow
i forget how i want it, how it crept up on me
it takes over, electricity
and my heart was breaking and got left unlocked
didn’t see you sneak in, but i’m glad you stopped
tell me something i don’t already know
like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
separated, there i face it
love like thunder, love like falling snow
tell me something i don’t already know
like how'd you get your kisses to fill me with electricity?
i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed
the lights were a-flashin'
and tongues were a-waggin'
over you
it's too late for tryin'
it's too late for denyin'
all those little things
you and me have done
i'm sorry, hon'
i was hopin' for a recall
a mix of you high from the sun
oh, but nothin'
only lone magpies come
i saw you dancin'
you moved like sinatra
on speed
black as a beacon in a river of shimmering fog
yes, she was
if you were heatseeking, she was hard to ignore
yes, she was
and she snapped wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particular pretty ones
and that meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on
well, time tastes bland
when she's not around
and you'd sit and you'd sink and approach the brink
before she showed you how to shake love's steady hand
tha knows
and she snapped wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particular pretty ones
and that meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on
shake love's steady hand
shake love's steady
she floats like a niccy rush and stings like a b-flat
the blond-o-sonic shimmer trap
and she snapped wing mirrors off of cadillacs
the particular pretty ones
and that meant she never had to strain her back
when she was putting her lippy on
you've never met before
but still she greets you like a long lost rock 'n' roll
she's definitely one of those
where you'll go wherever she goes
and with my body on my mind
both stop talking at the exact same time
trying to think of ways to make her mine
but they're difficult to find
it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
and she said, "oh
well, i know this will sound cold
but i really have to go
no, it's not that i'm not free
there's nowhere i need to be
it's just your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me"
it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
and she said, "baby, how can i believe you?
how can i believe you when you can't believe your luck?
no point sticking to the plan when it's come unstuck"
it's more a hunger than a thirst
she'll break your heart the second time
before you know about the first
looks well equipped to leave you in the lurch
but you'd let her do her worst
and it's not hard to tell
it's obvious the other angels' faces fell
when she told him that she had to go
swapped her wings and overcoat for something colourful
tha knows
it's not what i need
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
no, your love's not what i need
so don't give it to me
your love's not what i need
sat at the side of the pool at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
and worlds collide as the evening continues
the dignity fucks off
her brother's gone off to the strippers
to make up for all the lost time
she could have been one of the bitches
but she's actually alright
cigarette smoker
i'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to
maybe not have any more
a country home, even if we really tried
wouldn't cease to surprise us now
and i bet your dad would like to give us all a slap
when are your parents back? d'you know?
well, i never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
well-spoken girls in stilettos
aren't something to fear
cigarette smoker
i'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to
maybe not have any more
cigarette smoker
i'm sorry, but we're all unsure how much you've had
but we think that you ought to
maybe not have any more
cigarette smoker
cigarette smoke doesn't hide as well as you think
and you'd think that it ought to
act as the perfect disguise
you thrive on dancing in our laps before the more familiar chaps
who know the curtain leads to fever
we watched the womaniser cry, and in the last sip
you and i declared we might require a breather
i am the truth's true truant
i can feign excitement fluently as solid as i can busk shock
with well-presented merriment
and i know all too well i shouldn't break the key off in the lock
and the tumble splits the frame
revealing silk and fits
in the fright lined dining room
throw a gaze towards them while they feast
the days drag their heels
when you're not there to crack the whip
and the weeks wait to burst like a sachet of brats
the old pantomime villain follows my coat
and he hides where it hangs
and he spies through the slats
and meanwhile in the desert's only costume shop
the cowls hang and wait to rot away the identities of the willing
so i'm back to sugar in the night
rocketing shutter doors despite the shop not opening for hours
you can itch, flap and whistle and try to avoid the tock
as i scribbled over drivel, you were snoring; showing off
the tumble splits the frame
revealing silk and fits
in the fright lined dining room
throw a gaze towards them while they feast
been trying to think of something colourful for the season
pull the wool over the gullible for no reason
you are all i have these days, shake it up and run away
with the night squabbling behind you
from the smoke in your hair
to the blood in your bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots
i thought i heard them talking in their sleep yesterday
and i tried but i just can't believe a word they say
hurry up, they'll be here soon, sleeping in the afternoon
while the rain is trying to prove a point outside
from the smoke in your hair
to the blood in your bruise
and the bows on the shoes you kicked off
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots
those people make me cough
can't the flame come up to the moth for a change?
and darling, if it's all the same to you
i'll have you to myself
i'm joining the dots
i'm joining the dots
have a listen to it, i don't know...
i like the way you look at me, baby
please don't try to turn out the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
but girl, i'm in a muddle tonight
would you tell me where you're gonna take it?
if i had a heart, you're the one who should break it
the engine's running
can't decide if i should ride away
you and i
you and i
i had a woman, she went away
and now i'm lonely
fuck it
you and i
you and i
you and i
you and i
would you tell me where you're gonna take it?
if i had a heart, you're the one who should break it
the engine's running
can't decide if i should ride away
you and i
you and i
you and i
you and i
you and i
you and i
i like the way you look at me, baby
please don't try to turn out the lights
i act as if i'm not going crazy
but girl, i'm in a muddle tonight
the painted faces congregate
in the mating season
to second homes, they go alone
in no rush to leave them
and there's a fountain and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and cuts you down to size
when the people there and the furniture
start to seem important
when a moment more, when you catch the floor
with a vivid and absorbent sharpened arc
like the scimitar
shaped yellow light
that picks you up
and cuts you down to size
well, i had questions for the tap dancer sat on my lap
and she had child-proof caps on her answers
stone blower, blow me a stone
and show me that handsome enhancer
she had a rock on her throttle
and a brown glass bottle full of shavings from the sun
although those shoes affect your step
don't forget whose legs you're on
and there's a fountain and a scimitar
shaped yellow light
and it picks you up
and it cuts you down to size
made me kiss ya with a whisper
and violently you swung through unfamiliar tongue
couldn't listen to tradition
grab me by the wrist to silently insist
and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls
you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
unsugared taste
we'll waste away the evening
the afternoon and the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at
you stood shirtless and confident
listening to the fools, tickling the rules
their obsessions followed patterns
sat upon their stools with their attitudes
and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls
you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
unsugared taste
we'll waste away the evening
the afternoon and the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at
and when i'm in the confines of crawling walls
you hold me in place
the ripples on the ceiling, the avenues
unsugared taste
we'll waste away the evening
the afternoon and the afternoon's hat
together we'll find something to direct some laughter at
one, two, three, four! (roll that faster, man)
one, two, three, four!
(oh, we gotta time that
the whole point of a count is that it's in time, innit?)
one, two, three, four!
well, i watch you tangle every weekend
it might start different but it ends up the same
one minute, you're casually speaking
the next it all goes up and you pour fuel on the flame
with your jerrycan of words and tones
and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently
oh, he said, settle for the draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for a draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure
you should settle for a draw
why don't you settle for a draw?
well, you're right, it is one set of rules for her
and then another set for you
but that's just the way it is, i suppose
and there's nowt you can do
and let's not fall in the trap of answering back
i am just a beginner but she'll be the only winner
that's for sure, so take the draw, if it's available
and if it sets on fire
don't get out your jerrycan of words and... tones
and no one's gonna start a revolution
so we best leave it well alone
and there's something that frankie used to say
apparently
oh, he said, settle for the draw
well, you're not gonna get no more
so you should settle for the draw
i told you once i'm sure, i told you once i'm sure
you should settle for the draw
why don't you settle for the draw?
i wrote, "i was here", i.d.s.t
on the bathroom mirror, i.d.s.t
i.d.s.t., i.d.s.t., i.d.s.t
i.d.s.t., i.d.s.t., i.d.s.–t

when i got back from fixing my hair
you were directing the traffic
letting your story slip on the snow
as if the transmission was automatic
it's arguable that i shouldn't've been there
it was fortunate timing
i had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat
and my love dropped into the lining
(have you got your strange?) not on me
i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?) not on me
you can't sleep until you've sat on the steps
to weep 'til you feel like you've wept, yeah
(as long as you don't forget your strange)
(have you got your strange?) no, not on me
i haven't got my strange
(have you got your strange?) not on me
i haven't got my strange
i've better fetch my strange
i haven't got my strange
i haven't got my strange
007 and brucey wayne
are shitting them sens because there's another name
coming to claim what is his to claim
ten percent faster with a sturdier frame
he's certainly come into his own
there's one on his arm in every land that he roams
and two consecutive nights alone
are a thing of the past as he has recently shown
they said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last
are two things you'll never be, my darling
another roll around and another push and shove
further away from the idea of love
and his conclusion, it must be good
or when the penny has dropped with an incredible thud
forgot to kick the tin
he knows where she's going, but don't know where she's been
and as opposed to the other thing
he'll worry about it when it's trouble he's in
they said he looks so handsome, stood not dancing
drawing you in like it's boring to him
it's a war you can't win and the first and the last
are two things you'll never be, my darling
(two things you'll never be, my darling)
two things you will never be, my darling
(two things you'll never be, my darling)
well, he sneered and sniffed and spat at my chat up-lines
not to feel like a twat at times, it's hard
but not for this kid, not when they come to you
get out the way, mister
with your short sharp tips
no, i won't read your lips right now
and baby, hey
you send a shiver down my spine
but do you read my mind
do you?
and you're looking pretty suspicious
and probably planning a heist
he's wanting to go to the strippers
it makes him feel all nice
(cigarette smoke yeah)
the cigarette smoke in your eyes
watching a stripper and
(smacking a bloke yeah)
smacking a bloke here tonight
get out my way, mister
with your short sharp tips
no, i won't read your lips right now
and baby, hey
you send a shiver down my spine
but do you read my mind
do you?
he's probably got stopped by a panda
for speeding on his way there
flashing of digital cameras
from tourists in trafalgar square
(cigarette smoke yeah)
the cigarette smoke in your eyes
watching a stripper and
(snortin' some coke yeah)
snortin' some coke off her thighs
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah-blah
(cigarette smoke yeah)
the cigarette smoke in your eyes
watching a stripper and
(smacking a bloke yeah)
smacking a bloke here tonight
and i just can't see for the
(cigarette smoke yeah)
the cigarette smoke in your eyes
watching a stripper and
(snortin' some coke yeah)
snortin' some coke off her thighs
lalalalalala laaaaaaaoooo
owww
